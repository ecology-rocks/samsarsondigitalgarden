Immortal Burden By Sam Sarson

So what happened to Ari after she fell at the hands of an angry god in Immortal's Gift? Well, it turns out that she went on to do some great things.  
  
Ari finds herself suddenly in charge of the half-gods -- all of the mistakes that the gods have made over the years. She meets Toby, a teenager who is just beginning to understand his powers, and with his help, she forms a university where all half gods can travel to for sanctuary and training.  
  
Join Ari, Arkonel, and all of your favorites, in a ride that will take you across the boundaries of Olympus, Europe and America as Ari completes her first task as a goddess, and Toby learns what being a half-god is all about.
