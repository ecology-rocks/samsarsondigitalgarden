Ivy Hickman can see the light at the end of the long, long, graduate school tunnel. She's only a few months away from completing and defending her thesis when a startling opportunity becomes available: a chance to travel to a remote tropical island for the summer.  
  
The trip to Kir'nu takes an unusual turn when she and others are warned repeatedly to stay away from the "restricted area." The rangers blame wolves for mutilated corpses and strange noises, yet, Ivy is not convinced. Every time she gets close to the truth, she is driven away by Ranger Alex, a man with many secrets and one agenda: to keep the island safe from destruction.  
  
Alex Sloane has been alive a long, long time -- and never before has he felt this way about anyone. His urge to protect Ivy is overriding his common sense and endangering everyone on the island. Can Alex control his urges and remember his duties in time to save the island and its people? Or will they all fall to the evil hidden in the restricted area?
