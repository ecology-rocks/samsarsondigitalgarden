In the village of Dyssa, a boy becomes a man by slaying a dragon. At the tender age of fourteen, Stan rescued his best friend Mira from a dragon. Since then, Stan has been hailed as Dyssa's hero. He has spent his time training under his father, Dyssa's shaman (and leader), to inherit the kingdom.

When his father suddenly dies, Stan inherits the kingdom and a deception so large that it could uproot the entire civilization that his father and predecessors have built. Will Stan be the hero that Dyssa wants? Or will he be the hero that Dyssa truly needs?
