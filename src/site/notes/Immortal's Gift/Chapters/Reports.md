# Reports

  “What have you to tell me, son?” Zeus asked Arkonel as he stood before his father, head bowed.

  “She had a wonderful time today.  She does not know of my immortality.  She likes my company.”

  “Surprising.”  A voice from the shadows echoed through the hallway.  Cadmus emerged from the shadows.  “Well met, brother.”

  “And you, Cadmus.”  Arkonel scowled.  His brother was not the nicest person in the world.  Arkonel might be no angel, but Cadmus meant ill wherever he went.  Arkonel just caused mischief.

  “Babysitting is going well?”

  “Its not babysitting.  I am keeping the young mortal company, and you of all people should be grateful for that.  Were she lonely, she may lose faith, and her faith is what keeps scum like you alive and well.”

  “I’m hurt, baby brother.  So father, have you told him yet?”

  “Cadmus, get out of my chambers.”  Zeus admonished the older of the two brothers harshly.  “What I have to say is for Arkonel’s ears alone.”

Cadmus bowed without another word and his horned head left Arkonel’s view as he ducked back into the shadows, and outside of the room. 

  “You mean well overall, Arkonel.  If you can maintain keeping Ariana company through to the day she leaves for college, I have a new position open.  Having thought about it, I have figured it is time to have a God of Computers.  Now, as you know, your brother already holds the title for motor vehicles, but you have come of age to be responsible for your actions, and you should be rewarded for those good actions.  However, if you, to use a human phrase, ‘fuck it up’, from now until the end of that human’s summer, your brother Cadmus will receive the title of God of Computers and have those abilities.”

  “Yes, sir.”

  “Please don’t make me give Cadmus that.  There is one other way you will guarantee your title.”

  “Find a mate.”

  “As always.  As soon as you find one, you are guaranteed a title.”

  “Yes, sir.”

  “You may go back to watching over her.  And Arkonel?”

  “Yes?”

  “Have you kissed her, yet?”

  “I have been a complete gentleman, by human terms.  Did you want me to mate with her?”  Arkonel asked his father, surprised.  His father usually discouraged such mortal-immortal relationships.

  “I was just wondering.  I’ve just yet to see you spend more than an hour with a mortal woman without attacking her with those manly charms.  Hell, I can count on one hand the number of times I interacted with a mortal woman without having a desire to mate with her.  Its built into us.  We crave that which we cannot always have.”

  “Father, I can have anything I want.”  Arkonel snickered.  “You, however, are married.”

  “You should know by now that I can, too.  The four or five times I’ve actually interacted with a human were either the sister of someone I’d chosen as a mate, the mother of someone I’d chosen as a mate, or these people in modern times, who wouldn’t consider it an honor to lay with a god.”

  “Oh, I’m sure they would consider it an honor.”  Arkonel laughed.  “They just might have to call their police force and then get befuddled when you strike them down.  Its troublesome nowadays for you, isn’t it?”

   “Yes.  They almost respect too much those things which they cannot see.  It is easier to remain in human form and not grant those humans the rewards they deserve.”  Zeus agreed.  “But it must be harder for you, Arkonel.  Those few whom you have revealed yourself to have probably laughed before you killed them.”

  “I never kill for ignorance, father.  I’m not like you.  I kill for abuse, and for disrespect that is direct.  If they do not believe me, I just turn into something ferocious and take a chunk out of them, then resume my normal shape.”

  “Your morals are as twisted as mine, son.  Go now, so you can watch your ladies.”

  “Why did you marry Hera if you didn’t love her?”  Arkonel asked the timeless question.  Zeus shook his head, and threw his hands up in the air.

  “Go.”   Zeus commanded Arkonel, without a straight answer. 

   “Thought I’d ask.” Arkonel shrugged, not really expecting an honest answer in return – even gods made mistakes.  He then turned and went back to the earth.
