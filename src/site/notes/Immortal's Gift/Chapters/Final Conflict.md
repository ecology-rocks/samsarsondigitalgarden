# Final Conflict

  “We have returned.”  Zeus’s gravelly voice echoed moments before his humanized form appeared.  “Now will you please tell me what is so important to rouse me from my studies?”

  “It is Cadmus’ job to do that, sir.”  Arkonel said, gesturing to his brother and pacing, trying to broadcast feelings of worry and fear.  In order to fully screw his brother over, he needed to act the part. 

  “I stole his mortal.  Now, he gives up his title – the one that you have guaranteed him – to me willingly, and I give him the girl back.”

  “And you expect him to just grant you the rights to the title that should be his?  You know only full gods have received more than one title.”  Zeus said, also hiding his amusement.

  “I am different.”  Cadmus’ horns shone red in the bright warehouse lighting.  Ari was shooting death glares at Cadmus and Arkonel; awed surprise at the personification of Zeus.

  “Well, I’m sure you are, however I suggest you release the girl.”  Zeus said, leaning back on the wall behind him with mild amusement.  “In fact, I’m surprised she hasn’t escaped yet.  You have dumb and dumber there,”  Zeus gestured to the two nymphs, dressed as warehouse attendants, “Guarding a mortal.  First of all, they’ve got about as much strength as a new born.  And second, if you hadn’t realized, this ‘mortal girl’, is an immortal.”

  “That can’t be!”

  “Yes, it is.”  Arkonel smirked.  “Although unchanged, she is immortal.  You’ve been holding an immortal captive, unwillingly.  Tsk, tsk, brother.”

  “Unchanged, is she?”  Cadmus asked, walking towards his captive.  Ari looked at Arkonel, worried.  “Well, that does mean one thing.  I’m going to assume that you and this slut have slept together already, which rules that out.  So, unless she falls asleep in…about two seconds…” Cadmus closed the final distance and before Arkonel or Zeus could stop him, fired a round of a gun straight into Ariana’s chest.  “At least I still got to kill her.”

  “Ari!”  Arkonel yelled and crossed the room, leaning down to pick up her limp body.

  “You bastard!”  Arkonel shouted and made a completely mortal lunge towards his brother.  He surprised his brother and managed to knock him to the ground and maul his face seconds before the body disappeared underneath him.

  “Happy days, brother.”  Cadmus said, and Zeus disappeared in chase of his second youngest son, his voice thundering in the warehouse seconds after he disappeared.

  “You are to appear before the council _now_, Cadmus.  Everyone knows it is a crime to change an immortal fully without their permission.”  The thunder echoed and then faded.  Arkonel looked up at the nymphs, still awaiting orders.

  “You two are free to go.  Your master will not be joining you for a long time.”

  “Thank you!”  They chorused, and disappeared, leaving their clothes behind.  Arkonel crouched by the limp body of his lover, already dead.  She would be waiting for him in Olympus, confused and angry.  It was time to face the music.  His friend, Hermes, would dispose of the body for him.  Arkonel had really hoped to change her himself.  Ah, well.
