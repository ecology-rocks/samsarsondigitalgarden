# Unexpected Company

Somewhere between Mufasa’s final breath and Simba’s rescue by the warthog and meercat, the door bell rang.

  “I’ll get it.”  Ari said, beating her mother to the door.  She glanced at the clock, which read 7 at night, and wondered who could possibly be visiting that late, unannounced.  She brushed her hair out of her face and opened the door, recognizing Arkonel the moment she saw him.

  “Oh.  You again.  Hello!”  Ari said, genuinely surprised.  Arkonel had been crafting a plan ever since he overheard the conversation between Ari and her mother about her friend count.  The only way to stay in Ari’s good favor was to score her some friends other than himself.  Assuming she would consent to drive him, he had already checked out the evening life and came upon a few people that Ari might like to befriend.

  “Whose at the door?”  Ari’s mom yelled to her, engrossed in the ‘hakuna matata’ theme song.

  “That guy I was telling you about.”  Ari yelled back and then opened the door wider.   “Do you want to come in?  We’re watching the Lion King.”

  “No thanks.  I actually came to ask you if you wanted to go up to the town tonight.  Its about a ten minute walk from here; I don’t have a car, but I’m pretty sure we can find something to do.  I think there’s a bowling night or something.”

  “Sounds like a date to me!”  Ari’s mom yelled, gaining more interest in her daughter and her new friend than the television.

  “Its not a date!”  Both Ari and Arkonel called back to her, and then looked at each other and shrugged.  Arkonel could tell that Ari was attracted to him, but getting involved with a mortal could mean extra consequences.  Ari grinned sheepishly at him.

  “Not yet, anyway.” She said quietly so her mother couldn’t hear her.  “Unless you’re not…”

  “Maybe.”  Arkonel said to her, smiling amiably.  There was no harm in letting her know that there was a possibility.  It was just minimal.

  “I can drive, you know.”  She said.  “Its not your fault you don’t live around here, either.”

  “You don’t have to.  It is a beautiful night.”  Arkonel said.  “Are you sure its okay with your mom?”

  “Mom?”

  “Sure.  Just don’t rape and kill her, please.”  Ari’s mom had gone back to intently watching the children’s film. 

  “I’ll try not to.” Arkonel called in and then offered his arm to Ari, as he would to a royal lady in history.  “Shall we?”

  “Sure.”  Ari said.  “Let’s walk.”  She refused his offer, pretending she hadn’t seen it, and motioned for him to walk outside.

  “Baby, do you need a flashlight?”  Ari’s mom called just as she was about to shut the door.

  “I’ve got one, don’t worry.”  Arkonel said.  He reached down, materializing a backpack and a flashlight inside it next to a bush, where Ariana couldn’t possibly have seen until that moment.  It was easy being an immortal.
