# Calling Out

  “Cadmus!”  Arkonel shouted into the void.  “You come out in the next ten seconds or I am going to rip your immortal balls off, steal your nymphs and violate each and every one of them!”  

  “Calm down, brother.  What’s your problem?”  Cadmus appeared moments later.

  “Where is she?”  Arkonel growled at his brother, angrily.  Immortals could not fight the way that mortals did, but Arkonel was suppressing the mortal urge to hit his brother.  Not that it would make any difference, or even cause him any amount of pain.

  “Safe enough.”  Cadmus said, a smirk spreading across his ethereal face.

  “I want her back.”

  “Why don’t you come with me, and I’ll show you her.”  Cadmus suggested, and Arkonel nodded.

  “Where?”

  “Minneapolis, a warehouse shed on the eastern edge of town, owned by CCA.  Don’t try to steal her back before I get there.  It won’t work, and then I’ll have to kill her.”

  “Fine.  Meet you there.”  Arkonel said.  He materialized in the warehouse moments after his brother did, standing there in a sort of natural form.  Arkonel crossed his arms, annoyed.

  “Father and the council are going to banish you from the mortal plains a long time for this.”

  “Why would they?  They all have done the exact same thing.  Now, I assume you know my demands.”

  “You want the title.”

  “In front of Zeus.”

  “No.” Arkonel said. “Show me she is safe and unharmed.”

  “Fine, but don’t try your speech thought with her.  I may not be as…blessed as you; but I will know.”

  “Deal.”  Arkonel said.  He didn’t need to use his special thoughts with Ariana.  She knew that the changes would have taken effect by morning.  He had told her, hadn’t he?

  “Bring her out.”  Cadmus charged one of his nymphs.  The nymph brought Ariana forward out of the broom closet, bound at the hands, feet, and gagged.

  “Now, you know as well as I do that I don’t give a shit about mortals.  If you don’t give me what I want, she dies, and you’re delegated to dead duty for the next two hundred years.”

  “Fine.  In front of Zeus.  Allow me to retrieve him.”  Arkonel suggested.  He had to double check something, and he didn’t want Cadmus to know.

  “Fine.  You can try to get out of this all you want, but our father adheres to the rules.  Taking a mortal as hostage is perfectly legal in all senses, and so is the death of one upon the refusal of a deal.  They just get reborn again.”

  “I understand.  I will return.  Ari, are you okay?”  Arkonel turned his attention briefly to her, saw her nod, and then disappeared to find his father.
