# The Plot Of The Ignorant

  “I have to get this new title.  Electronics sucks.  Computers is going to be the new form of water in another hundred years, I know it.”  Cadmus said to one of his servants in the mansion he had built for himself in Olympus.  Well, created.  The nymphs that kept it up for him were simpletons, really, but he needed to work out his plans with someone.  Talk to someone, before he went crazy.  If he went to any of the older gods, he would be laughed at.  Maybe even have his plans discovered.

  “I’m going to kidnap the girl.  Ransom her.  He cares about her, and if he doesn’t care enough, then he’s going to get sent to Hades for a long time for her death.  Maybe I’ll kill her after he gives me the title.  Just to spite him.  He doesn’t need to go and get involved with a mortal.  It only fucks things up.”  Cadmus growled at the nymph closest to him, who nodded sympathetically, not saying a word.

  “I’ll have to go after her when he’s reporting to father though, that’s the only time that she is going to be alone.  Maybe…three days?  Maybe tonight, who knows.  Will you take good care of her if I put her in a cell somewhere on earth?  I don’t want to deal with Arkonel if he actually finds his little toy before he gives me what I want.”

The nymph in front of him nodded again.  Cadmus shook his head.  “Maybe I’ll convince her that she wants me, instead.  Then, when I release her to him, she’ll come right back to me.  That would really fuck him over.”

The nymph nodded yet again, bobbing its head up and down methodically.  Cadmus looked at the nymph and sighed in disgust.  “Sometimes I wonder why I keep you rats.  You keep the mansion’s appearance up, but that’s about it.  Maybe I need servants with half a brain.  But, you do follow orders well…”

Cadmus gave up on talking to the nymph, and instead gave it an order.  “Go to earth as a human and find me a large cage, like you would put a tiger in.  Buy me a warehouse also, to use.  If one can’t be found, then buy me an empty parcel of land and let me know, so I can build it myself.  Understand?”

The nymph nodded again, and Cadmus resisted the urge to backhand the creature and watch it fly across the room.  It would certainly be fulfilling.  He resisted the idea, and instead opted to give it another order.

  “Bring your sister here to pleasure me before you leave.  Go!”  Cadmus said, shooing the nymph away.

  “This is going to be good.  This will be written about in _mortal_ texts.  And immortal ones.  No one has pulled off something this big since that brat Arkonel was born; and that was just father covering his own ass.”  Cadmus said to himself as he leaned back to await the arrival of the blonde haired nymph to service him.  There were some benefits to being a god.
