# Anna

### Rob

  

We got home around 5 or 6 that night. We had eventually wandered out of the mall after terrorizing the preps and eating. It had been an interesting day, but my day wasn't quite over yet. They had left me off at home, and I left again. I headed over to Anna's house. We had decided earlier, in the morning, that we would go to the movies with each other, or at least chill. I hadn't seen her much this week at all, and she probably thought I was avoiding her.

I walked down the street. The sun was barely below the trees, but it would be set by the time we emerged from the movies if we decided to go. Steve was back onto his computer, I think, because there was no sign of life in the house.

I walked by his house and over to Anna's. Her house was at least, lit up. You could see people inside watching television or something. I rang the doorbell, and I could hear it echo throughout the house. A moment later, an older woman, I'm assuming Anna's mother answered the door. Her long black hair was pulled back into a braid and winded through it were silver strands of hair. 

"Hi, is Anna around?" I asked respectfully. She nodded, and smiled at me.

"Anna! A boy's at the door for you!" She yelled back behind her. A second later, Anna came down. She had a simple shirt on and some jeans – you could tell she wasn't expecting company. 

"Forget?" She grinned at my question.

"Nope." Was her reply. I shrugged at her, and she continued, explaining."I don't feel like going up to town. Wanna come in and do something?"

"Eh…sure." I said, surprised. She opened the door and her mother went back into the living room. She let me in, and I stepped in, taking off my shoes. There were various portraits hanging around the house as I stepped in. She grabbed my hand and led me into the living room.

"Mom? This is Rob. Dad? This is Rob. Rob, these are my parents."

"Pleased to meet you Mrs. Bolton, Mr. Bolton." I said, trying to smile pleasantly at them. I was also trying not to shake. They smiled and said hello, then returned to a quiet argument about something or another. 

Done with introductions, Anna grabbed my hand and led me into her room. Her room was covered with posters and her computer was on, quietly playing some punk. She sat in her computer chair and pointed to her bed.

"You can sit if you want."

I nodded and sat down. She turned the music down even farther and spun around in her chair, putting her feet on her bed.

"Hi." She said decisively. I grinned.

"Hi." I said back. We both felt really nervous – it was the first time we had ever been alone together.

"Your parents let you bring random boys they've never met into your room?" I asked her. She shrugged.

"First time I've done it. Do yours let you bring girls home?"

"I'm not home enough to let them meet any females, they hardly know me as it is. I'm always off doing something with someone. I don't think I've seen my dad in 2 days." I looked down, avoiding the sight of her legs resting on her bed.

"Wow. I don't think I've ever been without either of my parents for more than a day. Don't you miss them?" She asked, genuinely concerned.

"I guess. I've found more of a family in my friends." I shifted, uncomfortable. This wasn't why I had a girlfriend – I shouldn’t be discussing my private life with her. Oh wait…yes…I should. Is this what Julie meant when she said I had to use a different head?

"I see. I don't know what I'd do." She replied after a moment, measuring my reaction and wondering if she should continue.

"I don't need anyone to tell me how to live my life. I love my parents, that I will admit, but they get on my nerves, so I stay away. It's just our way." I responded. I was strong – I could take care of myself? Why then, are you so affected by this conversation? Asked the damn voice in my head. I told it rudely to go fuck itself. It left me and Anna alone.

"So…?" She asked me, as if expecting something out of me. I shrugged.

"Your house. Your choice of things to do." I said now, trying not to be cross. She grinned and got up out of her chair, standing in front of me.

"Oh, really?" She asked, sounding way too innocent for her age. I nodded, unable to hold back the grin of anticipation from my face. She laughed and pointed to my legs. 

"Can I sit there?"

"Of course." I answered, and without another word, she sat down on my lap, leaning back against me. She was eager – I put my arms around her waist and pulled her close to me. Her two legs ended up wrapped behind mine.

  

### Julie

  

A few days had passed after our mall excursion. My friends and I didn't really see each other during that time span. We just kind of wandered off all on our own to discover new things in our houses, to spend time with our families.

Ray and I were reading together like mad. It's Tuesday now, we've read at least 8 chapters a day in some of his books since Sunday. It's hard to keep up with the kid, he reads nearly as fast as I do and I have a tendency to zone out while he's reading to me.

I'd been searching the Internet for somewhere to go on vacation with my parents when they had vacation time. It was hard work, finding a decent camping spot somewhere in the state. I didn't really want to go – I would rather go skating or hiking along the canal for a day. At least it would be semi familiar territory and I would know where I was. There's always that slight chance of getting lost.

My dreams are getting better too. I haven't been waking up sweating and drooling and other 'bad' things like I did last week. I switched which side of the bed I sleep at – that might have helped a bit. Adam's been over for a few minutes every day, just stopping in to say hi. We haven't really talked much, not since the way to the mall. I wonder about him sometimes. I have no idea how he feels about me or the other two. He keeps it all hidden – it annoys the hell out of me, especially now when I want to know.

Ray wants me to go biking with him today, but I said no because I'm going to go skating by myself along the canal again. Its an ungodly time in the morning as I'm writing this, its like, 5:30. I woke up this early on purpose – I'm about to leave for the canal, as promised. I'm getting my backpack ready and writing in between. Today will be fun, a day just for myself and my thoughts.

I picked up my water bottle and went into the bathroom, filling it with tap water. It didn't really matter what kind of water it was. It was going to be hot today. I set the water bottle down and took all of my clothes off. I put on a sports bra and a white wife beater that said "Corrupt" in royal green lettering on it. I put on some new shorts too, cargo shorts that went down to just past my knees. Surprisingly they weren't heavy.

My goal for the day was the next town west, Holly. The town in general wasn't a very good town, but it kept me out of trouble and gave me something to do. And it was the only way that the people had paved on the canal. The other way, east, was gravel and I couldn't navigate gravel on my skateboard. If I wasn't so lazy, I might get my bike out and bike east one day.

I picked up my pen again, looking down at the journal. It was covered in blue ink, in my messy script writing.

  Right, I should probably be going now. I'll be back later on tonight to write some more, and I'll tell you all about it. This will be something to remember – I've never skated this far. I have a feeling my legs are going to kill tomorrow morning.

I shut the journal and stuck it in between my mattress and my box spring. Hidden properly, I grabbed my water bottle and went downstairs, leaving the backpack. I would just put the stuff in my pockets. I only needed water, money and a bit of food. No one was awake, but they knew where I was going. I had given them plenty of warning in advance, and I set the water bottle down on the table. I looked in the corner of the living room, as if to make sure my skateboard hadn't grown legs and walked off on me. Today was going to be fun.

I reached into the cupboard, pulling out some snacks – trail mix and some energy bars for lunch. It probably wouldn't take that long – or I might go skate around Holly for a while. It was 5 miles away, at about 6 or 7 miles an hour…I'd have plenty of time to explore. My parents said also that I could stay out all day if I wanted to, as long as I made it home by nightfall. They didn't care that I was out exploring. At least they knew I wasn't with the normal crowd. 

Setting them down, I ran back upstairs and grabbed a small notebook, small enough to fit comfortably in my back pocket. I sought out my favorite fountain pen and placed that into my back pocket too. I'd write all day. I'd sit in the middle of an unknown town, observe, and write all day. Sounded like a good plan to me.

I ran back downstairs and grabbed the water bottle. Being indecisive, I took it and put it into my right pocket on the outside of my knee. Uncomfortable, I changed it to my left. I then put the snacks in my right pocket. It would do. 

Finally, I hopped up the stairs a final time, going into my room and seeking out 10$. I placed that in my front pocket, then walked a tiny bit quieter down the stairs. 

I looked around the darkened house. I didn't see the cat, so my stay in the house was over. I grabbed my board, and walked out the door into the rising sun's early rays of warmth.

The breeze was cool and the birds were noisy. The dew hadn't quite left the lawns yet, and I was the only one out as far as I could tell. I knew, however, that there would be more people once I got up to the canal. People always jogged and stuff on the canal, especially in the early hours. And, up until today, I had considered them insane. Of course, now I couldn't really talk, because look at where I was. On the road to the canal.

I turned onto the main road and began skating uphill. I passed John – he was making his paper rounds again. Instead of just skating by him, he said something and I stopped, turning to say hello to him.

"What are you doing up so early, Jule?" He asked me, smiling. I could see he was tired, and I shrugged.

"I'm going up on the canal and skating towards Holly."

"Wow. How long is that going to take?" He asked me, as he walked back towards the next house.

"Not sure. I have to get going though. I should be back by tonight. Going to the daycare at all?"

"Yeah, maybe later on. See ya!" He shouted, kind of. I nodded, waving goodbye to him. I continued on my path, slowly beginning to skate uphill. My legs weren't even tired yet, which was a good sign. This was actually the hard part of the trip – the canal at least was even terrain and easy to maneuver. There would be people but I could also sit and watch them go by and take a rest or something. 

I heard a car coming in the background. It was loud, you could tell it didn't have a muffler on it. I turned around to glare at the driver as it approached, and I saw the man who had haunted my dreams and terrorized Rob and I. What the hell?

Without hesitation, I picked up my board and started running. The car revved up slowly behind me, and I could tell that he wanted me. I wouldn't have run but he slowed down. And now I could hear him following me.

It was like something out of a movie. My heart was racing. It was early morning and I was being chased by some male adult in a car. Why wasn't anybody up yet? Shouldn’t they be? Especially with that car that loud. People had to be up…

I looked to my right. There was a span of woods there that I could duck into and the guy wouldn't be able to follow me. I looked at him – he was slowly, patiently following me with his car. He had time…I didn't. Making a final decision, I split into the woods. The harsh vines grappled with me and I struggled to get through while keeping my skateboard intact. 

"John!!!" I yelled really loud, though I doubt he could hear me. It was worth a try. Instead of running towards the canal I started running east, deeper into the small patch of woods. It would soon break out into fields – I knew that much, and then I'd be screwed. Should I try to circle back home? Stay in the woods? I was screwed either way if he saw me. 

I thought about slowing down, and I did only so I could be quieter than I was. I had gotten away out of eyesight. Now I had to stay out of eyesight. The old trees offered no barriers to my small body as I leaped over them and crawled in between them. Thankfully there weren't too many thorns, so I didn't really get caught. The skateboard was burdening me…I didn't want to leave it but didn't really have a choice. As I continued jogging silently as I could through the dead brush, I looked for a spot to hide it. Finally, I found a log and I covered it with dead leaves. At least it would be safe there.

Having both arms free, I crouched down a moment and listened for the man. All of the woods echoed an eerie silence. I could see the fields up ahead, but I didn't want to go there. Not into the open yet. 

Next to me was a pine tree, an old and healthy one. I looked at it…and I could have sworn it looked back at me. With nothing left to do, I crawled in between its needles and began climbing. I hopped easily up the branches. They were thick, like steps, and rather evenly spaced apart, unusual for a tree to be so healthy. But I climbed up and up, until I was about 20 feet up. I couldn't see out, but I felt safe. Taking a breath, I straddled the branch, leaning my back against the tree's massive, comforting trunk.

I reached into one of my pockets and pulled out the water bottle. I sucked on tip of the bottle thirstily. I could feel my heartbeat echoing throughout all parts of my body. I shifted and pulled the notebook and pen out of my other pocket. Shaking, I scribbled a note.

"Help – I've been chased by the dump guy. Ask Rob – he'll know. Skateboards under a tree. I live on 39 Angela Drive - Julie – call 5956387824 when you get this. "

I looked at my shaky handwriting and laughed. At least it was a possibility if the guy caught me – which I had no intention of him doing. I ripped off the note and listened outside. Still, the eerie silence reigned the forest. I put the water bottle back in my pocket, and put the notebook back too, in case I needed it again. With nothing else to do, I folded the paper in half lengthwise. I bet the corners in and folded the wings back. I had made a paper airplane. Now?

I stood up slowly, carefully, trying not to lose my balance on the tree limb. The limbs were getting thinner although they were still sturdy enough to support my weight. I climbed a tiny bit higher, until I could see out above the treeline. I saw the road, about a half mile away. The guy's car was nowhere to be seen. Had I been imagining things or something? Maybe he hadn't been chasing me…I looked the other way, maneuvering over to the other side of the tree. The field was there, and someone's house too. Good. It was only a few short trees away too!

Taking aim, I sent my airplane flying. It fell just over the short trees and into the line between the trees and the persons' grassy field. Good enough, I guess. It would have to do, because I have other more…pressing…matters on my hands. Like where the hell that guy went.

I descended the tree, down to the middle where I wouldn't be seen and I'd still have a nice branch. I sat down on the branch I had been sitting on before. My heart wasn't slowing down at all yet, but it didn't really matter at this point. 

I should have grabbed my mother's cell phone when I went today. If I had been smart, I would have. And I could have called and asked her to come get me, someone was harassing me. Or I could have called the cops. Something similar to that. But now, like a rabbit, I had been chased into hiding by something that wanted to…no. He damn well better not want to eat me. What did he want with me though?

Surely he still didn't want to take me to the police or anything. Other than breaking into the dump a long, long time ago, and getting caught doing it a week ago, I had never ever really broken the law. What if he was an undercover cop or something? The birds were chirping again, I noticed, slowly but surely. For the most part they ignored my now-clumsy attempts at remaining still. My heart was calming down – I was safe again.

More than anything, I felt silly. I shouldn't have run. It's not like I can't defend myself. And now it's nearly 6:40. Almost an hour has past since I left my house and I still haven't gotten to the canal path. Granted, I didn't feel much like skating now. I felt like going home, crawling into my bed and reminding myself who I'm. I feel like being protected.

I missed my family. My brother. What if the man had been watching where I live and was now going to my house to tell them that I had run away? What then? What would my parents say if they knew what Rob and I had did? And then I ran! That's the worst part of it – I was too chicken to face my consequences so I ran away. They'd be so disappointed if they ever knew.

I got comfortable and took out an energy bar. There was no way in hell I was getting out of this tree for another twenty minutes in the very least. I might as well eat. Get my energy back, because I had just lost a bunch of it in that excursion. I ripped the wrapper open and bit off the corner of it. The semi-sweet taste of granola chunks, sugar and chocolate filled my mouth, and I savored it.

As I continued to eat, my thoughts wandered away from what had just happened and to Adam. What would he have done? Well, he wouldn't have done anything – he didn't know the dude. Rob…I don't know. He'd be up in a tree right now, just like me. He's smart…or dumb…I'm not sure which. But he'd know when to run. 

The energy bar was soon gone and I looked at my watch. 6:45. I had another fifteen minutes before I'd get out of the tree. I turned my attention to the ground, listening and searching for signs of wildlife and human life. 

The squirrels were active this time of year, their young ones were growing up fast and learning the ways of the woods well. I could see one in the oak tree across from mine, running all around his mother and having fun. 

The birds slowly began chirping again as I stopped moving in the tree. My face was covered with a thin layer of dried sweat and I felt dirty. I needed to shower badly, though that wasn't going to happen for a bit. And after I got down, I was going straight home. Screw the canal…I needed my friends, not a nature trip. I needed my family.
