# Rock

### Steve

  

"Yes!" I said silently to myself as I clicked on the little button that said Upload. It was early morning, and I had just finished the website. With all the rerouting they asked me to do, I was a few days late but that was ok. I was still early considering the extension time they gave me. 

I looked as the multicolored, many-faceted website appeared on my screen. Eager to test it, I clicked on "Contact" and then typed in the manager's full name and hit enter. A new screen came up, bright yellow and black, giving me the manager's address, phone number, and a text box in case I wanted to email them. Perfect. 

I 'logged in' under the administrator screen name and entered a new name, address, and phone number. This was the real test. The other part I had entered into the database manually. Now, I was going to see if I could add the new information via a web page so that the owners of the site wouldn't have to call me every time they had an employment change. I hit enter, and it said "Success." 

I went back to the Contact page and typed in the name I had just entered. Seconds later, the information popped up. I was successful. One more job that I have finished. Now, I couldn't wait for the managers to call later on today. Or wait…tomorrow. Today's Sunday. 

I had the entire day to myself! I was amazed – chances like this didn't come up too often. What to do?

  

### Julie

  

I kept glancing at my watch but time had literally stopped moving at a normal pace. It crawled by, unusually slow as I sat and waited. Finally, at 6:59, I decided to get down. It was time to end this and get on skateboarding, whether I went home or on the canal. Plus – my ass was beginning to get sore and my confidence was slowly recovering from the scare it had earlier.

I stood up, starting to descend the tree in what I thought was a quiet manner. The branches all supported my weight, and only about eight feet above the ground, I sat and removed my water bottle from my pocket. I took a nice, fulfilling sip, feeling the water slide down my esophagus and come to rest in the pit of my stomach. I closed the bottle and put it away, then stood and took another step down. 

Bored of climbing down, I grabbed the branch below me and swung down. I swung forward and back once, then dropped the extra two feet to the ground. I landed in a crouching position, and I heard my knee give a small 'crack'. I stood up, turning around to examine my surroundings. As I turned, I saw a rock, a large one, begin to fly, and felt it make contact with my forehead. I stumbled and fell, as my vision of the world faded from the outside in to an interesting shade of black.
