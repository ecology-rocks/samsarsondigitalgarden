# Author's Note

I am thirty years old at the time that I am writing this note to you. I wrote the majority of this story about half my life ago (the last 4 chapters are written in 2018). This story follows multiple characters, one of whom has an unhealthy obsession with a teenage girl. This was one of the first large projects that I did, and I'm ashamed to say that my fifteen year old self didn't have the courage to finish it. My thirty year old self was not that fearful. My thirty year-old self is also more cruel.

So let's just be clear: this is a story, written by a teenager. It is, in some places, hilariously bad. I've tried my best to edit for clarity where needed. But, I also feel like it's a snapshot in time, in my life and development as a writer, and so, the majority of the text is untouched. This is a story written by a fifteen year old. Please be kind in your reviews. 

Yours truly, 

Sam
