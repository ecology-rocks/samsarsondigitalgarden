# Unlike Any Other

### Julie

"You have to let me go. Please." I choked out. It was meant to be a yell, but it came out as a whisper. The room I was in? It was very dark. It seemed to be painted black, even, but there was a sliver of light across the way at floor level. 

I wasn't sure how long I had been awake. It felt like hours but could've just been minutes. My whole body ached, the icy cold restraints digging into my tender skin. My body was in full panic mode. I had puked. Twice.  My throat burned from being both dry and acidic from the vomit. 

I felt something move in the dwelling around me. Heard the soft thud of what could only be a door closing. My heart kicked into overdrive. I wasn't sure if I'd survive the adrenaline rush, much less whatever my captor might do to me.

### Adam

"Mom, I have a really bad feeling about this." I tugged on mom's t-shirt to push her awake. "I just called Julie's house, and they thought she spent the night here, because she didn't come home. Her mom was about to yell at me. Mom. Are you awake?"

"Huh, what?" Mom blinked her eyes at me for a few seconds before a frown crossed her face. "Is Julie at Rob or Steve's?"

"I already called them. They haven't seen her either."

"Did you call Julie's mom back?" Mom was sitting up now, "Adam, please tell me her mother knows."

"No, I just got off the phone with Steve."

"Call her. Now." Mom got out of bed. "We need to get a search party together. She needs to call the cops. This is not like Julie. She could be in trouble."

### Kyle

My hands were trembling as I touched the door handle. Behind this one flimsy piece of wood lay my one true love. I twisted the knob slowly and pushed the door open. The fluorescent basement light flooded past the threshold and I heard her sweet little moan. Followed by a scream. 

"Let me go!" She hurled at me, breaking off into a wracking cough from deep in her belly. "Who the fuck do you think you are?"

No, no. It wasn't supposed to go like this. She was supposed to put her eyes on me and smile that soft little smile that she used on her friends all the time. She was supposed to shyly inquire how I found her. And then raise her chin up to meet my lips with her own. 

"I... I..." Stutters emerged from my mouth as she finished her coughing. "I... I'm sorry it had to be this way." I finished lamely. What had I been thinking? "I didn't think you'd... come on your own." The words tasted like metal in my mouth. 

"My parents are looking for me. My friends. Please, just... unchain me and let me go. I won't tell anyone, I promise. I'll make up a secret boyfriend. I'll say I was pregnant. Anything." She choked off again, but this time, with a sob. 

A mix of guilt, indignation, and anger flooded through me. No, this was not good. Not good at all. 

"Listen up, you little bitch." I regretted the words as they came out of me, but they just wouldn't stop. "You're mine now. Things are as they're meant to be. And we will get through this." 

"I don't know you. Please let me go." She whimpered. Her eyes were watering as she stared her black little eyes through my soul.

"I can't do that, I'm sorry." My resolve steeled. I had started this, and I would finish it. 
### Adam

"Julie!" I shouted as I scanned the trail for any sign of her. Everywhere I looked, I saw neighbors and friends spanned out, searching the brush. Hours had passed, and after seeing the evening news, someone had called in a tip about an abandoned skateboard along the trail between the two towns. Maybe she had fallen. 

"Adam!" Rob shouted. There was excitement, panic in his voice. "Come here!"

I stopped scanning the brush and closed the distance between us, my feet crunching along the gravel path. He had a piece of paper in his hands. 

"Look." He said, smoothing it out. "Julie..." 

I scanned the note, hearing others take up the alarm as they realized Rob had found something. Dump guy... dump guy... shit.
