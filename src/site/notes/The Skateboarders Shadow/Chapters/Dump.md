# Dump

### Kyle

Dominance. What exactly is dominance, except the struggle to exert your will over another person? And why do we always shun it? Society should face the facts: Dominance is what it is, and it will never be different.

It's everywhere. At work, at home, in families, even in relationships that are supposedly equal. The wife is dominant, or the husband is dominant – either way, one of them ends up making more choices than the other.

Dogs have dominance rules. Are we no better than dogs? Even cats have their own methods of superiority. Women, men, animals…it seems the world is just one big fight to survive.

I’m going to find me a dominant one. So I can take the rebellion out. So I can take the fire out of her eyes, and make her mine. Forever.

  

### Julie

"Hey Julie!" I heard Rob call as he looked for me among the dump's random objects. 

Though we called it the dump, it wasn't really a garbage dump or anything. It didn't stink, it was just a place where the town dumped a bunch of left over dead trees. Our fun was with the playground equipment that was torn out. The bright red and blue colors had been chipped off from the frames and rusted metal was just beginning to show through. The merry-go-round was one of our favorites especially – one night we had sneaked out of our houses and assembled it. The entire group was in the dump, playing on a broken merry-go-round that night, and we had all been laughing. It was the first non-stoned fun some of them had in a while. It was a full moon that night… 

The sun's setting cast shadows early on thoughts and our moods both began to swing to more teenage adventures, instead of childish ones. To suggestive things as he sought me, calling out random things in hopes of making me reveal my location through laughter. By random things, I mean the phrases "Boner!!"; "Come on Julie, let's go make children!" And the totally random ones, like "Cheese!" and "Hippo!". Though Rob was a teenager, he really was a kid at heart.

I crouched low with my skateboard next to me, ready to cheat and hop the fence, abandoning him there until dark. I was hidden by weeds, and I lost sight of him for a second as he wove in between the dump's obstacles. 

Suddenly, I heard someone yell. But it wasn't a boy's yell, and it was most definitely not Rob's voice…it was a grown man's voice. Shit! I grabbed my skateboard and launched it clear over the barbed wire fence, crawling halfway through the hole in the fence when I heard Rob arguing with the man. 

Sighing, realizing I would have to save his ass, I climbed back out and followed their voices. The man had Rob by the arm and was beginning to lead him to the front of the dump. Taking no time, I picked up Rob's skateboard, lying uselessly on the pavement. Dropping it and stepping on it, I launched myself forward, and yelled out. I tried hard not to stumble and fall off, which would be very like me. The unused road had many loose stones lying around it and it was much like a game of dodgeball. 

"Hey asshole, why don't you come after me. At least I have tits!!" I yelled out. The man dropped Rob's arm and looked back, astonished as I flashed him. The sun framed the man's face - his face looked a weird shiny black. He had a black shirt on and had very hairy arms. He was scrawny and you couldn't really see any muscle on him, but he must have been strong to hold onto Rob like that. Rob outright laughed at my comment, and startling the man, Rob broke his grip and ran to me. 

"Mine's on the other side, get it for me!!" I called to him as he shot past me.

"Get a fucking job, you creep!" I shouted back to the guy as he ran after me. I picked up Rob's skateboard and ran like hell. My heart was racing, but I held onto Rob's board with a death grip. Throwing it to him on the other side, I crawled through the hole and felt the man grab for my shoe. Wasting no time, Rob grabbed my hand and yanked me through as I kicked, nearly losing my shoe. 

"You little punks! I know where you live!"

The man yelled at us, unwilling to go through the thorns and fence. It must have been too undignified for him, or maybe he realized it was futile to chase teenagers. By then we were already running again. Rob grabbed my arm, and he stopped for a moment, nearly making me trip and fall down. The man's eyes seemed to glint a crimson red in the setting sun as he squinted at us.

"Yeah, fuck you." Rob hollered, regaining his posture. Without waiting for a reply from the man, Rob handed me my skateboard and we jogged off across the fields. The sun was low in the sky, nearly disappeared. I realized I held Rob's board, as well as my own. I offered it to him as we slowed to a walk. I could see the man still watching from the hole in the fence. I think he was shaking his head. 

"That was kind of close, Rob." I said. I looked down at my hands, and saw that I was shaking. I had to admit, though pathetic, what had happened caused an adrenaline rush. I hadn't had one of those in months.

"Yeah, I just froze up. I shouldn't have gone with him. He would have raped me or something, probably. Thanks. But that was kind of stupid on your part. 'At least I have tits'." He mimicked me, smirking as well, and shaking his head in amazement.

"That all I get? Mocked for saving your ass? It's not like he could have raped me. I'm a big girl – I can take care of myself." I grinned, wondering if he had seen me flash the man as well. "Where are we going now anyway?"

"I don't know. We can't go home quite yet. We have to get out of sight first." He said.

"Think he'll call the police?" I asked Rob, resisting the urge to look back.

"I'm not sure. You didn't leave anything with your name on it there, did you?"

"No, only had my board with me. Did you?" I asked in return.

"No, I don't think so. I still have my wallet. Even if I didn't, we couldn't go back. The guy probably called the cops."

"Hey, did he tell you his name or anything? Did he work there?"

"I don't think he did. I think he was just dropping off something. But he didn't have anything he was carrying…no one works there, remember? It's abandoned. It's just a dump spot, it's not a junkyard."

"Did he have any sort of work tag on him? You know how most places require…"

"No, damn it. I told you. He had a black shirt on, just a plain T-shirt. He had some torn jeans on."

"All that in the ten seconds his hands were on you?” I asked him, a sparkle in my eye, and Rob rolled his.

"Fuck you.” He replied.

"How old was he?" I wondered, changing the subject. He looked to be about 30 to me, but he could have been either older or younger, I had only seen him clearly from a distance. 

"I'd guess about 40 or so. His hair was like, pure black. Not a white hair to be seen. Odd guy. I wonder why the hell he was there. Before he saw me, he wasn't acting like he was supposed to be there. He was like, creeping around or something."

"Maybe he's a mass murderer and that hole in the ground is where he dumps the bodies."

"You mean the one in the middle, in that secluded area?" Rob asked me. I nodded. The hole with the ladder descending down into it. None of the guys had the balls to go down and explore in there. It was creepy in that area of the dump – we stayed away from there. The dark hole was filled with water at the other end and it had been long abandoned. He rolled his eyes at me.

"Don't start talking like that Julie. You'll have nightmares and then start whining to me. And then I have to deal with it."

"Nothing new. What sort of stuff did the guy say?"

"We weren't exactly talking. He just yelled 'hey!' and I jumped and by then he had grabbed my arm, like closed the distance between us in two seconds. His hand was all cold and clammy. So I was like speechless, and he said 'who are you?' I didn't exactly have an answer and I was just mumbling random combinations of ‘fuck’ and ‘shit’ to myself. So then he's answered his own question somehow, and asked another 'well why don't you come with me'. And I was like 'fuck no!'. And then you came as he was dragging me. He had an iron grip for such a scrawny dude." 

I followed Rob through the trees that were the barrier to civilization. The barrier of evergreen trees rose high over our heads and we were temporarily surrounded by darkness as we crossed through two of them. We came out by the daycare center, the place where we usually boarded. The street lamps flickered on and we looked for other skaters as we made our way into the lot.
