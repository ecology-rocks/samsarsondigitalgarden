# Adulting

### Steve

  

The company I work for is one hell of a company to work for. I do everything, and I mean everything they ask me to and it still doesn't come out good enough for them…

"Yes, I understand. Why do you need it to be pulled out of the database like that though? It's much easier my way, and it will provide less tinkering time if you need someone to play with the code for some changes…"

"But that's our original plan…"

"Yes…yes…I know that's the way you originally wanted it…but that's impractical…"

"Kid…sorry; Steve, are we paying you to do this?"

"Yes…you're paying me…" I shook my head, mouthing obscenities. I took a breath."Alright then. Your way it is. But, that's going to raise up the cost for the extra time invested."

"Again?" The woman's voice sounded over the receiver. How much?"

"About 100 dollars more… I don't know how many hours it's going to take, at least 4…yeah…"

"Okay…" Her voice sounded disapproving.

"Look, if you want to do it, go right ahead! Now, unless you have further objections…"

"None…" She said, "But…"

"Since you have no more objections, Miss Smith, I'm going to go ahead and work on it." I overrode her 'but', ignoring it and hoped she would too.

"Right. Bye." She said, sounding unsure of herself now that I had taken control of the conversation.

"Goodbye. Have a nice day."

I slammed the phone down on the receiver. Rob looked up from where he was reading a book. I shrugged, and he grinned.

"People piss you off, don't they…" He trailed off, leaving no question mark. It was a statement – not an inquiry.

"Yes, yes they do." I muttered, settling down to work on yet another round of pointless programming. I was supposed to have had this website done 2 weeks ago. Picky, indecisive people…

"You heard from Adam at all?"

"Not since I last talked to him. Why don't you call Julie's house and see if they are there? If I spend one more minute on that phone I'm going to break something."

"Awww, but Julie's parents are very respectable and loving. They'd understand your frustration."

I sighed, not looking up from the string of SQL I was editing. He obviously didn't know her number."Her phone number is on the bulletin board, dumb ass."

"Right. Thanks."

"Yup." I said lamely, erasing and retyping a command. This would take hours!

"Hey mom, is Julie around at all?" I heard Rob say into the phone. He found it the most amusing thing in the world to call Julie's mom his mom. He even went so far as to call her dad his own. They both accepted it – though occasionally, her dad glared at him. Mr. Fields worked hard for a living and wasn't always pleasant. He dealt with people too – I understood the frustration that he had sometimes. People can be so dumb, it's like their heads were wrapped in cellophane when they were babies and just recently has begun coming unwrapped.

"She went with Adam?"

"Yeah…" I heard her mom begin to explain on the other end. Annoyed at myself for not being able to focus, I picked up the fly swatter and hit myself in the forehead. It made a nice twang sound, and I found comfort in the stinging sensation.

"Oh alright…" Rob sounded seriously dejected."Yup…thanks mom. Bye." He pressed the "off" button on my wireless phone. He turned to me, and I realized that my eyes had strayed to him instead of my computer screen.

"She left with Adam. They went up towards the town I think. She said they'd probably come here sooner or later, but I think I'm going to go search for them in a few minutes."

"Mind if I come? If I don't leave the house I'm going to break the computer." I said after a moment, desperate for intelligent human company. Rob may be human, and he may have an ordinary attention span and intelligence level, but by no means was he ready for my nerd speak. I needed to yell at someone to make them understand – I had the need to rant and rave.

  

### Kyle

  

My beautiful – I'm not sure where she is. But it's of no matter to me right now. I'm painting her room, though I imagine she won't be staying here for very long. At first, she won't even be here. I have the perfect spot for her. For the first few days, I will give her my room. But my plan is not set in stone yet. I need to get some more things – like a bed for her. I also need to get some chains, in case she misbehaves. I can't have an unruly Beauty and give her free reign of the house at first.

I don't know what I shall do first. Her innocence will probably prohibit me from doing anything. I suppose I will have to keep her drugged for the first week. That way she won't know what is going on. That's alright – drugs are easy to get a hold of, especially because of where I work.
