# Descent

### Kyle

  

I knew where she was going today – I watch well. Strangely, she ran from me again. I don't like this game she is playing with me, and it is going to end very soon. This game of hide-and-seek will finish when she realizes that she can't escape. I will have to blindfold her though, because she can't see where I live, and where she will live, quite yet. That can happen after she learns who her real guardian is.

My beautiful, my light, she will glisten faithfully after I shine her. This game of Cat-and-Mouse won't go unpunished, but that can wait until she gets settled. Now is the time to wait for her.

I waited a few trees back, for her to come out of the tree she had hidden up, thinking that I wasn't going to find her. The cold cloth of the blindfold I had made rested uncomfortably in my hand. The car I had to transport her had shaded windows, so no one would see I was transporting someone, and the back of the house was where our driveway was, so no one would see her being moved.

I heard her moving slightly…but I knew she wouldn't be down for another ten minutes or so. My handcuffs were wrapped in cloth and I took them out, readying them for use. She could brook no argument with me when I decided to take her – I had made sure of that.

The trees made me uncomfortable. I felt very watched, but I pushed off the feeling while waiting for her. She escaped three times already. Once at the dump, once at the canal, and just now, she thought she did. She wouldn't do it again. That, I was sure of. The game will be over soon, and properly punished, she will grow into the light and beauty that she is. She will love me. She is mine.

  

### Rob

  

The winter's snow was cold and harsh. The wind whipped right through me and I could feel its awesome frozen fire travel through every inch of my body. I was cold – I could tell that much. But where was I?

I looked around. I was on a snow covered street – it was night time. Probably around 5 or 6 at night, because in the winter it gets darker sooner. The street lights were a dimmed orange, not shining to their full capacity quite yet. 

I heard nothing, and the only things I could see were the frozen flakes falling to the ground, and the dim outlines of houses around me. As I turned to walk, aiming to go somewhere at least, maybe find shelter, the snow picked up. It whirled around me, blurring my vision and making me colder than I already was. If freezing more was even possible.

As I walked, I stumbled across something laying on the ground and I landed face first into a pile of slush and mud. I spit it out, sitting up. I was even colder now, and I was shivering as I sat up and then got up onto my feet. I looked down at what I had stepped on.

Was it a body? I crouched down, viewing the dark outline with curiosity. Almost afraid, I touched it and slowly pushed it over onto it's 'back', so to speak.

It was the man at the dump, laying there unconscious. The snow slowed and finally stopped, and the dim lights brightened, leaving me feeling more alone and lost than ever I had before. I gently shook him, but I knew he was as cold and as dead as the snow itself.

I stood up, looking at his body in distaste. I didn't want to be anywhere near anything that had died. I turned away from his dead face, staring so blankly and openly into the stars and began walking away, looking at where I walked. I headed "left" from where I originally began, and was very careful not to step on anything else.

I passed the outlines of other bodies, and each time, I increased my pace. These people were not face down. The bodies were face up and what I saw, I didn't like. Steve. Adam. Julie. Ray. My mom. My dad. Was I alone in the world now? What killed them?

By this time I had gotten up to running, leaping and bounding over the broken bodies like a buck running from a hunt. As I ran down the street, it changed to someone's ice covered lawn and eventually I was standing in a snow covered field. The snow was beginning to thin out and the sky cleared up too. I could see no moon, but I saw the stars shining cruelly down at me. 

The snow thinned until I was walking on frozen flowers, and the night had warmed up. The wind had stopped its cruel torture, but I was mostly in the dark, except for the stars in the sky. I had slowed to a walk now, my run over. I looked back behind me but saw no remnants of the snow, bodies, or houses.

I took a few more steps before tripping over something again. I looked down at this body with interest. It was smaller than the other bodies, but without turning it over, I knew who it belonged to. Even so, I grabbed the person's shoulder and turned them over. I stared into my own lifeless face.

  

I awoke with a shiver, warm tears glistening within my eyes. Angrily, I wiped them off. That was the last draw – tomorrow night, I'm sleeping on the couch.

The clock read 6:30, much too early for me to be up. Especially in my house. Frustrated, I grabbed my blanket and wrapped it around me. I sought out one of my pillows and dragged it downstairs with me. Denying the last dream, I laid down on the couch and sought for another. Hopefully, I would at least get a dreamless sleep.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them stare back at me, first dead and lifeless then with a hatred I've never seen before in anyone's face. Then they changed. They weren't my eyes anymore – they were Julie's. She wasn't mad at me, she looked sad and somber like she was disappointed in me. I pushed her eyes out of my head and once again fell victim to my own mind's depressing, torturous images.
