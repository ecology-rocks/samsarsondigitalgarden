# The Little Things

Dina sat alone in her dark room. She had been reminding herself that she should most likely ask for at least a desk lap and a book to keep her company in her captivity. The man who was holding her would not let her get close enough to him to bite or claw his eyes out, and so she had pretty much accepted her captivity as a temporary fact of life. To be honest, she wasn’t really afraid for her life, because she had a feeling that anything more or less than this crazy man brandishing only a flood light at her would be better than what she was enduring now: ever lasting boredom.

She had almost given up on the small blue orb ever floating through the concrete bunker door again, that it had really been an imagination’s way to pass the time, when the small voice and accompanying light had startled her from her meditative stare into the darkness.

“My sweet!” The voice had shouted, echoing in the room’s walls. “I have come back to save you and keep you for my own, as I have so promised!”

“Whoop dee fucking doo.” Dina muttered, secretly glad for the company. “Is he gone?”

“He left – to get supplies, I believe. I found where he kept his keys though.”

“Well, what are you waiting for?” Dina asked crossly, suppressing the urge to whack the fairy so hard that he would hit the opposite wall.

“Your declaration of love.” Broon responded to her just as crossly. “Why should I save you if you have not fallen head over heels in love with me yet? There is no reason – you are in no immediate danger, and face no immediate threat from this man.”

“Yes, but if you don’t free me, I will throttle you until your little fairy wings crumble off.”

“Well in that case…” Broon puffed up his chest at her and disappeared into his little blue orb of light, floating too quickly away for her to catch him, despite her lunge and subsequent crash into the hard, cold metal door of her jail.

“Wait!” Dina cried out in desperation. She could not believe that she had let her anger get the best of her.

Seconds later the door to the bunker opened and the soft light of a basement light bulb flickered on above the entrance.

“I knew you wouldn’t leave me!” She said happily, making her way slowly out into the real world. The little fairy perched on her shoulder.

“You will love me in time, my sweet.” The fairy said arrogantly, kissing her ear. Happy to be alive, Dina even managed to tolerate it. Just this once.
