# Lisa's Power

“Can I touch it?” Lisa asked her teacher, Ben. He shook his head.

“Lisa, its really tender.” Ben complained.

Lisa had spent the majority of that day forcing Ben to talk to her. Since she was leaving soon, and he was still on pain medication, he was stuck in bed, and well, someone had to keep him company. The true companionship that Lisa had been lacking over the past month or two was finally being found, and Ben himself was rediscovering the beauty of conversation.

“That’s okay.” Lisa insisted. “I swear that I won’t hurt it.”

“Alright.” Ben struggled up and out from under the covers he had been lying beneath.  “Fine.” He groaned again as Lisa sat closer to his body.

“I swear I won’t hurt you.” Lisa repeated to him as she reached out and bared the rest of his skin. The wound, stitched, but still sore, didn’t look that amazing. It wasn’t so much the stitching that worried her, but the large purple mark around him.

“It almost looks like I hit you instead of stabbed you.”

“And how did you get the knife again?” Ben asked her, smiling. She touched his soft skin briefly.

“I don’t know. I told you that.” Lisa grumbled. She wanted to try to use the other half of her powers now. To help, instead of hurt.

“What are you doing?” Ben asked her.

“Be very, very quiet. I’m hunting rabbits.” Lisa winked at him, doing a bad impression of Elmer Fudd.

“Okay, you crazy little girl.”

“Don’t call me little.” Lisa responded to him, frowning and furrowing her eyebrows in concentration.

Lisa found the little white flower inside of her that she had been concentrating on. She had found it – just like Ari said she would – over the past few days, and she had been using it to affect the world around her. She was hoping that she could maybe completely heal Ben. Ari had told her that she had left him half healed just so Lisa could finish it up. Maybe regain some confidence in herself. Lisa imagined the flower opening inside of her. Lisa pulled one of the strings out and opened her eyes. Startled, she could see the white string in her hand with her ‘real’ eyes. That had never happened before!

“Close your eyes!” She ordered Ben, and laughing, he did as she asked him. She looked down, unsure of what to do from here, and decided to do what she could. She reached out with her free hand and pulled the string from her hand smeared the white energy onto his wound.

“What are you doing?” Ben asked, surprised. He felt a warm, tingling sensation.

“Hush.” Lisa ordered him, continuing her work. She kept putting more and more onto him until the entire thing was covered. She looked behind her briefly to make sure that no one could see what she was doing. Then, she slowly pushed the stringy paste into his skin, and released. The remainder of the string flowed back into her. As the twinkle disappeared, she looked at his skin. The bruises around Ben’s shoulder were gone, as were the stitches.

“What did you just do?”

“Fixed you.” Lisa announced. “I took your stitches out.”

“And the bruises.” Ben said to her as he opened his eyes and examined his shoulder. “Shit, girl. You got more of the god genes than I did!”

“What?”

“That’s right. I’m part god, too.” Ben admitted to her. “But you need to stop showing off. I know you’re here to discover yourself – but suppose I was mortal?”

“You would have accepted me for who I was?” Lisa asked him.

“Well, yes. But I probably also would have accused you of satan worship and gotten you expelled from the temple, in the very least. You have to understand. Outside of this temple, don’t expect to have your extra skills accepted.”

“I know.” Lisa said. “Ari said it was safe to do that, though.”

“She would.” Ben laughed. “I nearly killed someone in my younger years.”

“Really?”

“Yes. Then I got a day out on the town and a little bit of extra instruction as well.” Ben said.“And when I came back, they told me I could stay. And I’ve been here ever since. Because I know that if I walked out of those doors out there, and I accidentally did something that would count as supernatural, I would be killed by a mob somewhere. I know I would.”

“What are your skills?” Lisa asked him.

“Well, I don’t have the whole power over life and death like you... ” He said pointedly, then continued. “But I have an unusual control of water.”

“Are you Poseidon’s?”

“I don’t know. No one ever really owned up to me on Olympus. So Ari said. And before her, it was just Hermes who was helping me out here on earth. But I’m not his.”

“I don’t know who I came from either.” Lisa admitted. “Ari said I’ll find out eventually. As will every half god.”

“I never got that promise.” Ben said, surprised.

“Apparently, its something new.” Lisa declared. “Now, this means, of course, you can work.  Any pain?”

“No. Feels better than before you stabbed me.”

“Sorry!” Lisa said guiltily.

“It wasn’t your fault.” Ben assured her.
