# The Beginning

 _“Who are you, and where did you come from?”  The woman asked in the shadows, clutching her comforter to her chest, wringing it in her hands._

  _“I am no one of concern to you.”  The shadow rumbled as it moved closer to her, and in desperation the woman reached over to find her husband gone.  A realization occurred – her husband was gone for the night.  “I’ve been watching you for some time now, and I want to give you a gift.”_

  _“I’ll scream!  I’ll call the cops.”  The woman yelped, backing away from the figure approaching her, now climbing onto the bed._

  _“I can make this very pleasurable for you, and it is going to happen.”  The figure said._

  _“Please, what do you want?”  The woman realized that he had not made an indent in the bed he had just climbed on.  “What are you?”_

  _“A god.  I want you to bear a child for me.”_

  _“I won’t cheat on my husband!”  The woman protested, trying to back off the bed, bumping her head on the corner of the wall in the process._

  _“Its not cheating.”  The figure said.  “I’m not a physical being.”_

  _“No means no!”  The woman shouted, scrambling to get off the bed.  She felt a cool sensation grab her and pull her back._

  _“You know, that’s the problem with the English language... ”  The god said as he positioned her underneath him, “I always got those two words confused... yes and no?”_

_Hours later, she sat next to the figure, panting.  Exhausted, and completely sold to the idea of god-sex._

  _“You need to lie with your husband when he returns.  The baby is mine, and I will reclaim him one day.”_

  _“Why... me?”  She asked, closing her eyes, an overwhelming urge of sleep halting her protests again._

  _“Because you have an ancestor who happens to be only half mortal.  We need a leader of the demimortals.  Sleep well, love.”_

  _“I’m not... yours.”  She said, slipping into a dreamless sleep._

  _“All are mine.”  Zeus shook his head and jumped back to Olympus.  He would solve the problem of his brothers’ infidelities with one of his own._
