# Second Encounter

“What do you need, Toby?”  Ari asked as she appeared to him, alone in his room.

  “I just... I was thinking about it today, and I don’t mind if I take the job.  If you promise to be there every step of the way.”

  “Okay, we’ll get you –“

  “Wait, there’s more.”  Toby said, taking a deep breath.  “I want to meet my real father.  Just to...  hear it from him.”

  “Anything else?”  Ari asked him with a light smile on her face.  That was easy to accomplish, Zeus had calmed down and was barely busy at this time of the year.

  “I...  can I meet my mother?”

  “Someday.”  Ari assured him.  “If you choose or gain immortality, you may visit Hades and see her.  But right now, as a mortal, going to Hades would kill you, and you would be unable to return.”

  “Will I become immortal?”  He asked her.

  “If, when you are older and your task is completed, you would like to.  It is entirely your choice.”

  “Could I do it, now?”

  “No.”  Ari said.  “Rules dictate that only exceptional circumstances or true love can cross a mortal.  Or an immortal changing one, only one.  Which is usually their mate.”

  “My father cannot grant me immortality?”  Toby asked her, and she shook her head. 

  “Even he is under rules and regulations.  King of the Gods has a lot of responsibility.  This includes following the rules that he makes.  When you have done good here, you may reside there.”

  “You were under the true love clause?”

  “Yes.”  Ari said.  “Sometimes, I regret changing so soon.  I missed out on college.  Or have, so far.  I can always attend whenever I want.”

  “I won’t miss out on college.”

  “No.”  Ari reassured him. “Nothing will stop you from attending college and leading a normal life.”

  “Okay.  Thank you.”

  “Was that all?”

  “Yes.”  Toby said.  

  “I’ll be back in a few days, then, to begin your lessons.”  Ari told him and prepared to leave.  He still wasn’t completely sure, and she wanted to give him some time to think.

  “Okay.  Bye, Ari.”

  “Good bye, Tobias.”
