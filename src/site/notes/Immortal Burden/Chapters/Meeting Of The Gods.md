# Meeting Of The Gods
“Report your progress, dearie.” Zeus said to Ari as she and her husband entered the palace dining room. They had been invited to sit and talk a while.

“How come I never got called, ‘dearie?'” Arkonel asked his father as he pulled a chair out for his wife to sit in.

“Because I like her better than I like you.” He retorted. Arkonel sat down, laughing. He wrapped his arm around his wife and pulled her close.

“I could say the same of you, father.” Arkonel settled on a response and then kissed Ari on the forehead. “And do report your progress, dearest.”

“Well, I warned those few that set the woods on fire last year that they had to respect the boundaries now that there was a council overseeing them. There was the brief incident with Poseidon’s son... ”

“Did you ever get him to master that?” Zeus asked, and Ari laughed.

“I know our time runs differently, but honestly. Its only been a day in mortal time. They’re slow creatures compared to us. Give him at least a mortal month.”

“That had to be amazing. I wish I could have seen it.” Hera entered into the conversation as she placed drinks in front of each of the guests and her husband.

“He was a beautiful dolphin.” Zeus told her. Hera sat beside him. “I’m sure you can see him later on.”

“I know I will. Ari, do tell him to come to my temple and talk with me a while. I would enjoy it so very much.”

“I’ll let him know.” Ari assured her mother-in-law. “Other than that, it is going very well. We’re slowly hiring people to fill in where the immortals are placed.”

“I’m still not sure about that.” Zeus huffed. “Mortals, even gifted ones, are so unpredictable at times.”

“I know, but its better to keep hands busy than to leave them idle when they have power to play with.” Ari reminded him. “Isn’t that how most of the immortal conflicts start?”

“You’re right. I just wish there was more supervision. Are you sure you don’t want help?”

“Arkonel helps me plenty when I need it. Its not like he does anything on earth that is useful. Right?”

“Right. Wait a second – sure I do!”

“You hole yourself up in a different cyber café every day and play new video games.”

“Well, as the god of computers... ”

“Bull shit.” Ari retorted, slapping her husband’s arm. He shrugged ruefully.

“She always stops me before I can start that speech.” He complained, and the older couple sitting across from him burst out laughing.

“I don’t blame her.” Zeus said when he had himself under control. “And I thank you, deeply, Ari, for doing us that small favor.”

“I do it with all of the pleasure in the world.” Ari made a mock bow towards the table. “After all, he’s my husband.”

“Most definitely yours. I don’t know about husband. Servant may be a better term.” Hera indicated to her, and Ari smiled in silent agreement.
