# Plea For Intervention
“So what are we going to do?” Toby asked Ari, sitting down at the grand hall table. It was late at night, and it was just him, but Ari had asked him to show up.

“Ask for intervention.” Ari responded to his question. “If anyone can fix this without a lot of work, it would be Zeus. He may make an exception to the rules of engagement for us. All things considered.”

“Which are when we started a school for the gifted?” Toby asked her. It had probably been less than twenty four hours, but he was still worried about Kat. What were they doing to her? Toby and Kat had just begun to become friends, and he had even begun to look at her with interest. Maybe someone like him, but more than a friend, was just what he needed. But if everyone he befriended was going to disappear, then why bother?

“Yes. And, you have to remember that some of those gang members of Alexanders’ had powers that we don’t know or recognize. Some of them may not have had any. Without knowledge of this, we can’t chase after them.”

“I can’t. You can.” Toby told Ari, and she nodded.

“You’re absolutely right. But we still don’t know what their powers are, so its not going to make the searching process any easier. We may have to do it the mortal way.”

“The mortal way?”

“On foot.” Ari responded. “And that could take a long time. If those bastards move around a lot, and never leave us a ransom note – which I doubt they will, at least for a while, then it may be years before we find them.”

“And do you really think Zeus will intervene?”

“Quite possibly. After all, you are his youngest, and he likes you a lot.”

“He likes all of his children quite a bit. But that doesn’t stop him from being the ruler of the gods and mortals.”

“There are other possibilities, too, you know. Even Zeus may not be able to help. We don’t know what her power is. The only thing that we know about Kat is that she is gifted in some way. She may not even be a god’s child.”

“I thought we only accepted gods’ children.” Toby asked, confused.

“No. We accept half-immortal children. The term half god is misleading. She could just as easily, although more rarely, be the daughter of a nymph, or a fairy, or a centaur, or any of the other possibilities.”

“Why would that matter?”

“Because the parents hold a link to the children. They can always find their children, dead, alive, or unconscious.” Ari told him. “And Zeus does not have complete dominion over these creatures.”

“Who does?”

“The Great Lord and Lady.” Zeus’ voice sounded from behind Toby, and he turned around, not really startled by his father’s presence. “Those whom even I worship.”

“The Source?” Toby asked, and Ari smiled.

“Whatever you call them, they are the ones we all worship.” Ari answered him. “Welcome Zeus. I was just about to call you.”

“Well, you know. I heard what happened from Hermes and Arkonel, and I decided to come down and hear about it from you two.”

“Katrina disappeared.” Toby said. “We found her dog by the woods with a broken front leg, which Hermes healed. There is no trace of her.”

“And I take it Ari has been filling you in on the nuances of my rule?”

“Yeah.” Toby nodded. “Something like that.”

“Well, I’m not sure there is much that I can do. I think that the gods that you would have to go to would be the ones who announced their ownership of the trouble makers at that last meeting. Ares and Aeolus, primarily. But if that group has say, a quarter nymph and half god among them who we don’t have completely identified, those two as well may be at a loss to help you.”

“I doubt Ares would, anyway.” Ari pointed out, and Zeus shrugged.

“He might. We all seem to be getting soft in our old age.”

“Will you search for her, father?” Toby asked. “This is all my fault.”

“Don’t lie to yourself. And I will see what I can do. I know she was very dear to you and this operation. But I’m not god of everything. Just mostly everything.”

“I know.” Toby said, deflated and losing hope.

“Did you try talking to the fates?” Zeus asked Ari, and she shook her head in denial.

“I did not. But Hermes did, and he said all they did was laugh at him.”

“Again, I don’t control those three. That sounds like a very... fate- ish behavior. But she is still alive, correct?”

“Yes.”

“Ari, did you take her anywhere? You could transfer her finger print to Hermes and he could find her.” Zeus suggested.

“Thought of it, and no, I haven’t. No one has.” Ari responded to his question with another shake of her mortal-ized head.

“Well, I’m not sure what to tell either of you. I’ll keep my eyes out, as I’m sure you two and others close to her and this organization will. Maybe you could send out a search team of some sort?”

“Could we grant her immortality?” Ari asked, and Zeus shrugged.

“You know those rules as well as I do. A god can turn one person in their life. And it must be their true love who does it.”

“Okay... ” Toby trailed off. “So we either find her parents, find the ass holes who did this, find her true love, or wait for a ransom note?”

“If she wakes up, someone can put a trace on her and find her, most likely. Do you know if that works, Ari?”

“I haven’t tried it with her before. I sent out the invitations according to a list that Hermes compiled. He received that knowledge from the fates, in exchange for getting them some physical object from ruins. He didn’t hunt each and every person down.”

“So it’s a maybe on the trace.” Toby sighed and put his head in his hands.

“Our best hope is the ransom note, if they leave one.” Ari assured him. “They probably will, if only to get credit for the kidnapping. They obviously did it for attention.”

“I could strike them all dead.” Zeus offered. “But if we don’t know where they are, we don’t know if they’re like, driving, and that may hurt or kill this woman in question.”

“Katrina. I don’t even know her last name.” Toby corrected his father. “Should I...  break the news to my father?”

“What do you mean?” Ari asked, confused.

“I mean the part where I’m mostly god, and I just had a friend kidnapped, so I need to skip college in order to find and save her.” Toby explained. He looked up through his hands.

“No. You want to go to college. You’re going to college.” Ari told him. “This problem will be taken care of.”

“But what if they hurt or rape her?”

“In times of trouble, powers come out.” Zeus took the reassuring point of view. “That’s always the case of the gifted.

“I doubt she’s in any danger.” Ari joined Zeus. “Look, you need to focus on college. When you get moved in and settled, we’ll let you join the search.”

“How can you stop me?” Toby asked her. He spread his wings in defiance, tearing the shirt.

“Cute.” She told him, and patted him on the head. “We could stop you, but I think we’re just going to take a chance and trust you on this. You have more important things to worry about than one woman.”

“She’s not a lost cause!” Toby said angrily, and Ari nodded.

“You’re right, she’s not. But she’s not in any immediate danger, and you’re several days away from moving into college. You need to take a break.”

“I don’t want to!”

“Look at it this way.” Zeus said, growing stern. “You are not going to be any help to Ari and Hermes in the search for Katrina’s parents. This search is going to take a while in mortal terms, because it is going to take a while to get to each and every god and immortal and question them about it. That at least will take a week or two. You have nowhere to look, nowhere to search for her. What you need to do is relax and focus on your goals and missions. And when the time is right, you will be welcomed into the search for her.”

“Do you promise me? I can help?”

“When you are settled into college, and have everything under control.” Zeus told him. “I swear on my honor that you can help with the search.”

“Thank you.”

“But from now until at least a week after college, you need to stay off campus and at your home. You may be in danger, yourself.” Ari added. “I will give you updates, and be around whenever you need me.”

“What about Bernie?”

“Who’s Bernie?”

“Kat’s dog.” Toby insisted. “He needs a home.”

“I’m sure that Kat’s neighbors will take care of him. I’ll be with him often. He won’t get lonely.”

“Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?”

“You’re going to college in a week. Your dad can not take care of a dog.”

“Okay. Is that... it?”

“Yes.” Zeus said, reaching down and hugging his youngest.

“Don’t worry. Things will take care of themselves. Kat and you are both blessed in your adventures.”

“Go home, Toby. Take a nice long flight and calm down. Spend time with your dad.” Ari gave him a hug as well.

“Okay. I guess.” Toby rose, and looked at them both. “My life was so boring before you two. Thank you for everything. Even for being my father.”

“You’re welcome.” The two echoed. They waved good bye and disappeared. Toby walked out of the grand hall reluctantly, watching the lights flick off. They were right. It was time for him to relax at home. Stop worrying. Pack. He could help, very, very soon.
