# Night Time Wonders

 _The woman sat up in bed, sun streaming through her windows.  What had happened the night before? She had had a horrible dream, that an unknown... oh, the pleasure!  She hoped it had been a dream.  Hell, she hoped that the dream would continue.  It wasn’t cheating on her husband if it was only in her dreams.  She rose from bed and slowly began to piece together the events of the night._

_A man had appeared at her bedside.  Told her he had wanted a child.  Made love with her for hours.  Told her to have sex with her husband.  What did he say he was?  A demon?  No.  A god.  She had just made love with a god.  Was_ that _cheating?_

_She rose and went downstairs, looking for a cup to fill with coffee. A little past nine, John should be home at any minute.  He had said he was leaving early so he could make it back in time for breakfast.  He would be walking in... when?_

  _“Boo!”  A man’s voice came from the shadows and she whipped around, dropping her glass and shattering it on the marble countertop._

  _“John!”  She yelled, surprised.  She hadn’t expected him to sneak up like that.  “Look at what you made me do, hun!”_

  _“Oh, baby, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to.”  John apologized and walked towards her, helping her to pick up the broken shards._

  _“Its okay.  You hungry?”_

  _“Just for you.”  He said as he emptied the shards into the garbage can and turned to wash his hands.  “You want breakfast?  I can make it.”_

  _“I just want you.”  The woman said, moving towards him._

  

  “Toby, you awake?”  Toby heard Gary’s voice and moaned at him.

  “Go away, ass hole.”  Toby mumbled, throwing the pillow over his head.  “I’ll be up in a while.”

  “Dude, its like six at night.  Do you want to go out?”

  “Its _early_.”  Toby said, struggling to hold onto the new dream images.  The man was undressing the woman.  Both looked vaguely like people he knew, or people he should know.

  “K.  Be back at eight.”  Gary said, laughing and closing his door.  _Everyone_ had a key to the house.

  

  _“John?”  The woman asked as they lay in bed.  “What if... what if this is the one?  The one that gets me pregnant?”_

  _“Then we will take care of the child.  Shall we think of names?”_

  _“John... we’ve been trying for three years.  I just... never mind.”_

  _“Hun, we’ll have a kid, don’t worry.”_

  _“I know.”  The woman swallowed and sunk into her husband’s arms.  The question was if it was his.  And what if the only way she could have a child was by that... thing, that visited her last night?  What then?  Shouldn’t he have a right to have a child, too?_

  _“I love you, John.”  The woman concluded._

  _“I love you too, Anna.”_
