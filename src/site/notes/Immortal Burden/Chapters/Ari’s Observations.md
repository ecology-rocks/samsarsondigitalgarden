# Ari’s Observations

Ari looked through the scrying glass.  It has been a long time since she had actually managed to pull herself out of bed after the changes had begun.  This time, it was Arkonel’s turn to wipe her forehead and make sure she had everything she needed.  Well, the wiping was unnecessary, considering they were not really physical beings, but that didn’t stop it from feeling really, really good.  

The blurry image began to clear and showed a teenager, probably the same age as herself when she was changed to immortal, sleeping peacefully on his own bed.  She had gotten basic background from Zeus, and now she had to figure out exactly what Zeus didn’t know.  Mainly, was he capable of becoming the demimortal leader when she didn’t feel like doing it?  Could she train him properly?

  She entered his dreams, only to find the past recurring in his head.  The events before his birth.  Did he know what he was?  Or hadn’t it clicked yet?  She didn’t think it had, because he didn’t seem to have emotional troubles.  And, after all, realizing that your father wasn’t really your father, but Zeus was, tended to carry some emotional baggage.  Hell, look at her husband.

  “I can hear you think, darling.”  Arkonel came up behind her and placed his arms around her shoulders.  “I don’t have emotional baggage.”

  “The rivalry between you and your brother makes Zeus have thoughts of suicide, and he’s one of the more patient deities.”  Ari retorted, not taking her eyes off of the image.  “Look at this.  He has reverse prophecies – pre-birth memories.”

  “Does father know?”  Arkonel asked.  “That could mess everything up.”

  “Probably.  Isn’t that a common side effect of only being half god?”

  “I never had dreams of my father and mother having sex.”  Arkonel protested.  She could feel him give a shudder behind her.

  “I don’t think he realizes that its his father and his mother.  After all, his mom died in his birth.  As do most.  And the only father he has known is the one he has, John Shepherd.”

  “We should probably tell him.”  Arkonel said.  “You know, it might be important.”

  “Shush, you.  He’s my charge, now, and what I say, goes.”  Ari said, elbowing her husband in his very firm and hard stomach.

  “You’re right.  It is definitely your call.  But when Zeus shoves a thunderbolt up your ass, it is not my fault, by any means.”  Arkonel said, patting his wife on the head and moving away.

  “It wouldn’t be my ass, you know.”  Ari called after him.  “He loves me.”

  “Well, it wouldn’t be my ass.  I run faster than him.”

  “I can hear you, Arkonel!”  Zeus’ voice echoed through the room.

  “Hey, you’re not supposed to eavesdrop.”  Arkonel protested.

  “I knew he had prophecies.  I can’t help that, its part of my power passed on to him.  That’s part of the reason I pegged him as the new leader.”  Zeus’ voice continued to echo through the hall.  “You were going to tell me, right Ari?”

  “Of course.  Arkonel was just being an ass, and I decided to get him back.”

  “Such a loving relationship.  Don’t you see how I’m abused, father?”  Arkonel said laughing and returning to his mate.  He grabbed her roughly.  “She’s always insulting and beating me... ” Arkonel swayed her to one side of the chair, spilling some of the scrying bowl water.  The image held.  “She’s always neglecting me and what not,”  He swung her to the other side, “I don’t know why I married her.”

  “Because you love me, you dolt.”  Ari said, setting the bowl down and letting the image of the boy dissipate. 

  “Right.”  Arkonel said and tussled her hair.  “Are you gone yet, father?  We want to... work.”

  “Understandable.”  Zeus’ laughter echoed through the hall.  “I’ll leave you two alone.  But remember, Ari.  We have to act relatively soon.  They’re about to all get out of control.  Or something.  Toby hasn’t fully realized his power yet, but he will soon, and unless we get him, it could be dangerous.”

  “I doubt he’s going to kill anyone.”  Ari concluded, but Zeus’ presence had already left.  “And even if he does, they’ll just get reborn.”

  “Such a nice immortal you’ve become.  And to think, you were afraid of dying to begin with.”  Arkonel said, smiling.  

Ari rose from her seat and turned towards her husband.  She ran her hands through his now-golden hair then giggled, floating a few feet above him.

  “I think its time to play hide and seek.”  Ari said, shooting off into some other part of their house.

  “I’m all for sky sex!”  Arkonel shouted as he took off after her.  Screw worshippers, it was going to be a good afternoon.
