# Council Of The Gods
“We have a long list of people to get through.” Ari stood up to begin the meeting. Many of the gods were not even seated, instead choosing floating or other, more amusing positions, to retain during the meeting called by Zeus and Ari. “So, if we’re all honest and true, maybe we can get through it quickly and we can go back to ruling the world.”

Laughter met her final comment and eased the tension. Every god, goddess, and immortal capable of producing half mortals had been called, and all had showed. Even Cadmus, the god that had killed Ari just a few years earlier.

“I’d like all of you to go through this list later and pick the ones you think might be yours. It lists their powers, their birth date in mortal terms, their location on earth, their mortal name, and their mortal parents’ names. But I need someone to claim responsibility for the following.” Ari paused for effect, since she didn’t need to take a breath in Olympus. The silence was met with surprise by some. Ari continued.

“Alexander Perrie. He has the gift of wind manipulation. He was born in Coulsa, California, to a single mother by the name of Angelina. He was born twenty seven years ago. Any takers?”

“I dropped into California about then.” Cadmus raised his hand, grinning at Ari. “Glad to see you alive and well, Ari.”

“Nice to see you too. So, is he yours?” Ari got straight to the point. She was not surprised that he was there, but was still not happy about it.

“That one is mine.” Aeolus said from the back of the room. “My only mistake in hundreds of years.”

“Mistake?” Ari asked him. She had thought he would have said something.

“Yes.” Aeolus agreed. “I meant to have a child. I just didn’t mean for him to be such a disgrace to the race of man kind.”

“Well, he’s out of control. Control him.” Ari said. “Agreeable?”

“Absolutely. I will have a chat with him next break I get.” Aeolus winked at her. “The winds will suddenly disappear from half of the world... ”

“Joseph Gammond. He has the gift of fire. He was born twenty two years ago, in Coulsa, California, also. To a happily married couple – Harold and Jasmine. Any takers for this one?”

“He’s not mine.” Hephaestus defended himself as they all looked at the lame god. “I’ve been faithful.”

“Mine.” Ares called from somewhere in the middle of the room. “It was getting kind of slow on the battle fronts, so I decided to take a night off and make a soldier who had just been discharged blessed with a son.”

“He’s responsible for the deaths of thirty humans.” Ari pointed out to Ares, and he grinned.

“A true son of mine, then.”

“Your son backed up my waiting list for days. That was not expected.” Hades appeared lounging on the table in front of Ares.

“What do you expect?”

“Control.” Ari replied. “Go have a chat with him. He needs a little direction. Hell, tell him to go join the army and kill people the normal way.”

“Isn’t that what that mortal organization is supposed to do?” Ares asked Ari with amusement.

“We are not babysitters.” She replied. “And he’s not even the ring leader.” Ari looked pointedly at Aeolus. “Yours is.”
