Space Pirate, as he has been known for the last fifteen years, is a proud purveyor of goods for alternative and adventurous lifestyles. Situated comfortably at the edge of Epsilon 5, Space Pirate's Butt Sex Emporium caters to shy and bold customers alike with their classy atmosphere and knowledgeable staff.

But Space Pirate - Spunk, as he's affectionately known by his friends -- has a big problem brewing in the basement of the Emporium. One of his clients has left their shame-ghost behind and it's, well... it's getting messy. Spunk has tried everything to move this ghost to the great beyond, but nothing has worked yet. The ghost is getting obnoxious, pushy, and even dangerous.

New licensing and purity laws have made it even harder for Spunk to keep the doors open in a system crawling with space zealots. With a ghost in the basement, protesters in the parking lot, a sex toy inspector (yes, that's a thing) at his front door, and the pending eclipse set to take all systems offline for a full 48 hours, Spunk is left scrambling to make sure that the Emporium doesn't fall to pieces.

Join me on this ridiculous quest to create a queer space adventure that affirms and celebrates the quirkier sides of creation! This will be my seventh NaNoWriMo book, and it may just be the worst idea I've had yet.
