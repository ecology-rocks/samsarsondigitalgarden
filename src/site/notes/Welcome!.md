Some of us dream about writing fantasy books as a kid. Some of us muster up the courage to put pen to paper.

These books were fun to write, and I hope they're fun to read. I don't really have interest in becoming a best-selling author - I'd rather folks just be able to read and connect with what I've written. 

This website is my free resource for readers. Enjoy!

## Where To Start
