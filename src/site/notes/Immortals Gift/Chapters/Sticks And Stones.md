# Sticks And Stones

  “Cadmus, I am challenging you.  Come out, you coward.”  Arkonel’s thunderous voice shot through the immortal world like a lightning bolt. 

  “I was sleeping, brother.”  Cadmus’ voice appeared before his body did.

  “You’re a god.  You don’t fucking sleep.”  Arkonel growled.  “Now, I want you to listen to me.  Ariana knows I’m a god, so back the fuck off.  If you fuck this up, I will make you regret it by taking out power supplies for half of the world.”

  “Don’t threaten me, little one.”  Cadmus said.  “I didn’t do anything, and you can’t prove it.”

  “I know you’re behind it.  So, just back the fuck off.  Do you understand me?”

  “Sure, bro.”  Cadmus smiled, his horns shiny in the dark streets of Olympus.  “Go back to your toy.  I’ll leave you alone for a while.  She probably hates you now, anyway.  Tell me, I wasn’t watching.  Did you burst in, or did you sneak in and perform one of our many tricks used to astound the mortals?”

  “Fuck off, Cadmus.”

  “Ooh, even using the human speech patterns.  I was wondering when that disease was going to start sticking with you.”

  “Cadmus, I’m going to go back to my job now.”  Arkonel said, restraining his anger.  There wasn’t much he could do to his brother without coming before the gods’ council, and that would definitely remove his ability to visit earth.  He’d be stuck on dead duty for quite a while.

  “That’s right, run away.”  Cadmus said just before Arkonel disappeared and reappeared back in front of Ari and Gena’s residence. 

He realized that the police hadn’t even appeared yet.  He walked in to the house, back in human form, and walked up the stairs, knocking on the bedroom door before entering.  The two ladies were opposite the burglar, talking quietly.

  “Ari?”  Arkonel asked gently, calling their attention to him.

  “Hey.  Um, what do we tell the police?  With your…status, and what not.”

  “Let me handle them.  I came back as soon as I could.”

  “Okay.”  Gena said, relieved.  “Because I’m not exactly sure how you explain…you…to them.  They’d think we were crazy.”

  “No problem.  I’ll take care of it.”

 “Can I see what they saw, Arkonel?”  Ari asked boldly, looking at him with no fear in her eyes.  “Can I see the real you?”

  “Yes.” Arkonel agreed and changed to his natural form, disappearing and reappearing quickly, translucent.

  “Wow.  You’re even hotter than the human you.”  Ari said, looking at him.  His naturally brown hair curled just like his human form, but he was like any of the other gods – perfectly formed with striking eyes.  He looked down to make sure he was dressed, and saw the loin cloth, only.  It would have to do, for then. 

  “I love the eyes.  This is your natural form, or another illusion?”  She asked him, fascinated.  She reached out and her hand passed through him.  He waited until she removed her hand and then solidified. 

  “It is a toned down form of me.  Just as with any god, my completely natural form is incomprehensible by humans.  This is as close as it comes.”

  “Did you just turn solid?”  She asked, amazed, and reached out to stroke the light curly hair scattered across his chest. 

  “Yes.  You wanted to touch me.”  Arkonel turned away from her touch, and changed back to his teenage form.

  “The police are here.”  He said, moving towards the door.  “Just remember, let me take care of it.  They’ll arrest him for robbery, and he’s going to plead guilty and do some jail time.”

  “What about the trial?”  Gena asked him as he walked out. 

  “There won’t be one.  He’s going to accept a plea deal.  Right?”

  “Ugh.”  Was the only response from the man attached to the bed post, focusing on breathing. 

  “I hope he called an ambulance for himself, too.”  Arkonel commented, making his way down the stairs to answer the door.
