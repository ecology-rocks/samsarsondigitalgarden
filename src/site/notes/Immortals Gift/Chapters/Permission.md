# Permission

  “Gena?”  Arkonel peeked into the darkened bedroom.  “I know you were sleeping, but I need to talk to you, at least for a minute.”

  “What is it, Arkonel?”

  “I’m really sorry.  Its just…I think Ariana is the one for me, and I know that this life – this mortal existence – means a lot to her.  She means a lot to me, too.”

  “Well, of course.”  Gena sat up and flicked on the light to find Arkonel transparent.  He quickly solidified for her comfort.

  “Well, I think I’d like to take the next step with her, but she’s reluctant.  Now, tomorrow, I plan to visit Aphrodite.  But I’d like to…make her a goddess.  That’s the easiest way to say it.”

Gena looked up at Arkonel and nodded.  “I kind of figured that out as soon as I was told who – what – you are.  Will I ever see her again?”

  “Indeed.”  Arkonel assured her.  “She will be with me often, but she is free to come and go here – in her normal form – as often as she would like.  She would not age normally unless she adjusted her form.  She could actually maintain her normal life and spend her nights with me.  The biggest change would be her acceptance that you too, cannot be immortal.  When you die, you will join Hades and your loved one.  She can visit, but you cannot visit her.

  “Why will it be hard for her to say yes, then?”  Gena asked.

  “Because it will leave you, in essence, without a daughter.  I know Ari – and her heritage and responsibility to the family is very important.  We have not spoken of your late husband, but I know how much she loved him and how much she wants to carry on his lineage.”

  “I understand.”

  “She may feel a tug towards the immortal world more than to that of the mortal world with new found powers, etc.  She may make the mistake of losing track of time and not see you alive until many years later.”

  “So you’re saying that if I agree, I may never see my baby girl again?”  Gena asked him, and he nodded.  “I will become a lonely widow?”

  “Perhaps.  I will try to remind her, and I will be at her side, always.”

  “If you can swear that I will see her at least 21 times a year – the full moons and the 8 sabbats, then I will agree.”

  “I swear, on my honor and my father.”

  “Then you have my blessings for whatever it is you wish to do with my daughter.”  Gena said and then shook her head.  “I’d be more upset, but I have a feeling Aphrodite would smite me for standing in the way of something as rare as true love, especially after being blessed with it myself, for a short time.”

  “Thank you!”  Arkonel reached over and hugged Gena tightly.  “Now all I have to do is convince her.”
