# A Long Night

Ariana’s mom watched with satisfaction out her window as she heard Arkonel and Ari’s voices drifting up through the otherwise silent night.  It was a little past midnight, and Ari’s night had obviously been a success.  Her mom – Gena – was overflowing with happiness for her daughter.  Even with the counselor’s assurances from back home, Gena had never been sure that Ari would be able to fit in with a brand new crowd after 18 years of the same people.  Having no father also meant that Ari was a little bolder towards the opposite sex, but more as a friend.  Ari had never sounded so happy about a guy before tonight, and that was including ex-boyfriends.

  “I had fun tonight.”  Ari admitted.  Gena could no longer see the flashlight bobbing along, and their voices sounded as if they were coming from the porch.  “I’m really glad you jumped out of the tree today.”

  “Oh, really?  I’m glad you had fun.”  Arkonel said.  He had never been in this situation before. Usually the only time he spent around mortal women was when he wanted to mate, and that usually got him trouble.  He knew how to court, but he always got what he wanted by the end of the night, and then took off.  Not that he was courting Ari.  “What’d you think of that one band, the band we left at?”

  “I thought they sucked.  I prefer older music, myself.”

  “You talking about Aerosmith, the Beatles or classical?”  Arkonel asked.  He knew what he preferred – instruments that were in tune and not amplified to over 100 times their original sound capacity.  He didn’t know which mortal invented that, but he knew it sounded like shit.

  “I’m talking a little bit of everything that doesn’t suck as bad as that last band.  Are you sure you don’t want to take over our couch for the night?  It’s a long walk back to your grandmas.  Or, do you want me to drive you over?”

  “No, I’ll walk, thank you.”

  “Right.”  Ari said.  A moment passed of complete silence before she spoke up again.  “Am I going to see you tomorrow? Or was this a one-time deal?”

  “I showed up at your door this evening, didn’t I? That was twice.”

  “Uh huh.”

  “I’ll be back.”  Arkonel made a next-to-perfect impression of the terminator, eliciting laughter from Ari.

  “Okay.  I’ll be in the yard – not the woods – most of tomorrow, so you’re free to show up whenever.”

  “How about at 6?”

  “I’ll be asleep.  We just got in!  I need at least seven hours of sleep before I’m good for another day.”  Ari said.  “I’ve always been that way.  College is going to suck.”

  “I’ve seen college students.  It will suck for you.  They all tend to go insane.” Arkonel said, remembering one incident at a party where he released an angry, drunk boyfriend on a man who was attempting to date rape the first’s girlfriend.

  “Seen them?  I thought you said you go to college?” Ari said, suspicious.

  “I do.  Well, I went for two years.  I’m transferring to the University of Maine this year.”

  “Why?”  Ari asked.

  “Because I want to get away from people.  My father says I cause a lot of trouble, so I figure the farther away I am, the better.”

  “Oh.”

  “Alright, I will be going so you can sleep.  I shall see you on the morrow.”  Arkonel picked up her hand in the dark and pressed his lips on it.

  “That a Greek custom?”  She asked him, curious.  Secretly, her heart was beating fast, and she was screaming in her head, _No, you idiot, kiss me, not my hand!_

  “No, just a custom I enjoy.  It surprises women that men in this day and age can be sweet and endearing and respectful without asking for anything in return.”

  “Nothing at all?”  Ari asked, laughing.

  “No.  Usually, kissing someone’s hand doesn’t have the same erotic effect as pushing them up against a wall and furiously making out with them.”

Ari met this statement with silence, and Arkonel realized the mistake he made.  The only thing that was keeping Ari interested in him was the fact that well, she was interested in him.  He just shot that down.

  “Not to mean I’m not attracted to you.  I just don’t think its right to, as your mom put it, rape and kill someone on the first date.”

  “Date?”

  “Not a date.  Right.”  Why was Arkonel getting so tongue tied?  All he had to say was good night. 

  “Not a date?”

  “Gods damn it all.  Good _night_, Ari.  I will see you tomorrow.”  He reached up to hold her head steady, turned it to the side, and kissed her cheek, then spun on his heel and walked off.
