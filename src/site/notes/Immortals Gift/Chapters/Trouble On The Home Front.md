# Trouble On The Home Front

Three hours and thirty five bruises later, Arkonel watched Ari put the car into park and they sat there for a moment in complete silence.

  “So…”  Ari broke the kiss, looking at him for the first time as a submissive woman unsure of what to do.  Arkonel knew what to do.

Arkonel reached into the driver’s seat and placed his fingers gently on her neck and pulled her close to him.

  “Are you sure you want this?”  He asked her, and she nodded.  He did not want to pressure her in anyway – it could come back to haunt him.

Arkonel leaned in and closed the final distance, pressing his lips onto her.  To help the process a little bit, Arkonel began the process he would with anyone – he began projecting his feelings and desires out to her, letting her feel as much of the energy as she could.  She moaned and opened her lips slightly, but instead of taking charge of her, he gently ran his tongue around the outside edges of her lips only.  He closed his lips, pressing them once more to hers, and then backed off.

  “You need sleep.”  Arkonel said, trying to hide a smile.  He had turned her one, teased, and frustrated her.  They both knew it.

  “Walk me to the door.”  Ari said, unbuckling her seat belt.  She was hoping for a second chance to kiss him.  She had certainly enjoyed it the first time.

  “Okay.”  Arkonel agreed.  He certainly didn’t have anything else to do.

Arkonel and Ari got out of the car, and she claimed his hand as soon as she had walked around the edge of the vehicle. 

  “Are you sure you don’t want me to drive you home?”  She asked him.  “Its not that far, and I don’t mind.  Really.”

  “No.”  Arkonel said, firmly.  “I enjoy the night.  Its my favorite time of day.”

Arkonel looked up at the house.  Something wasn’t quite right inside.  He could tell, but he couldn’t focus with Ari standing right there in front of him.  He couldn’t pay attention to her and see what was wrong inside at the same time.

  “Ari, do you trust me?”  Arkonel asked her.

  “It’s a little early for that question.  I’m not having sex with you.”  Ari laughed, and Arkonel squeezed her hand.

  “No, I’m serious.  Not because I want to have sex with you.  Do you trust me?”

  “Sure.  What’s wrong?”  Ari asked him.

  “I think there’s something wrong inside of your house, and I don’t want you to think I’m crazy.  So I’m going to walk you back to your car, and you’re going to give me the house key, and you’re going to sit and wait for me to check it out.”

  “What are you, a psychic?”  She asked him as he tugged her back down to her car.

  “Just wait inside the car, alright?”

  “What makes you think something is wrong?”  Ari asked him, her eyes darting around his larger figure towards the house.

  “The window is open, screen is off.  The kitchen and living room lights are on, as well as the upstairs lights.  Does your mom ever leave lights on that she doesn’t need?”

  “No, but she might have for me.”

  “I’ve come home with you how many nights?  She leaves the porch, not the inside lights on.  Just trust me on this, alright?”

  “Okay.”  Ari said, doubtfully.  “You have five minutes.  I’m timing you.  And then I’m coming in.”

  “Sure.”  Ark agreed, then shut the door behind him and jogged towards the house.  The door wasn’t even locked as it should be.  He pushed it open and immediately saw that the cats, normally inhabiting the first floor, were nowhere to be found.  They must be hiding.  Smart cats. 

Arkonel dropped his human body and changed to his natural form, making his way upstairs, invisible.  He passed through the bedroom door to find the same burglar from the other night, reeking of alcohol, babbling at the scared mother/writer.

  “I know you have a treasure in this house, my boss told me about it.  Now, all you have to do is tell me where it is and I won’t have to fuck you and then your daughter in front of each other.”  Arkonel noticed that the man had Gena handcuffed and felt his immortal blood rising to an unhealthy level.  He decided that enough was enough.  The poor woman was terrified – she must have been surprised by the intruder, because even Arkonel knew that Gena was the type of woman to fight back.

  “Drop the knife and back away, James Tobias Redfield.”  Arkonel remained invisible and pronounced this.  “On threat of death, do it now.”

  “Where are you?”  The burglar – James – yelled, looking around confused.  It had sounded as though his captor was right behind him.  “Come out or the lady loses a thumb!”  The man waved the knife as if it were a lit piece of dynamite. 

Arkonel decided that appearing in his natural form would be the easiest way to take care of the situation.  And that he did, transparent but still visible.

  “Jesus Christ!”  The man hissed.  Arkonel glanced at Gena to make sure she wasn’t going to faint in surprise.  She was just in the corner, trembling silently.

  “No.  Try again.  My name is Arkonel, and I am one pissed off Greek God.  I wouldn’t be so fucking angry as I am right now except for the fact that you tried this shit once already this week.”  Arkonel slowly advanced on the man who tried to slash at him.  He started babbling when the knife went straight through Arkonel’s translucent body.

  “Please don’t kill me, please.  I swear, someone hired me to do it, and then told me to do this, too.  I wasn’t really going to hurt her, honest, please, no.”  Arkonel backed the man into a corner.

  “I’m not going to kill you.”  He said, his anger boiling down a bit.  He saw the fear in Gena’s eyes and didn’t want to see that every time he saw her.  “However, you are going to call the police right now and turn yourself in.  And you are going to uncuff the lady.  Either that, or I deal with you, and you pay for the damages this house will incur when I throw you out the window.”

  “Right.  I’ll uncuff her.”

  “How about you drop the knife you’re holding, first?” Arkonel suggested, sending heat at the knife until it was too hot for the man to hold.  It clattered to the floor.  Just then, Arkonel heard the door open, and he forced himself back into the human body.  The man stammered even more.  Arkonel waited for the man to uncuff Gena, and then removed the handcuffs from his hands.

  “Call the police, now.  There’s a phone, right there.”  Arkonel pointed to the phone next to the bed.  “You only need one hand.”  Arkonel suggested, as he grabbed the other hand and handcuffed it to the bed post.  He then turned and elbowed the burglar in the ribs hard enough to hear several cracks from his rib cage.

  “Call when you can talk again.” Arkonel suggested, then turned his attention to Gena, still backed into a corner. 

  “I’m a god – sent by Zeus to watch over you and Ari, and keep you company.  I meant no ill to you or your daughter by taking her out alone those time.”

  “Thank you.”  Was all that Gena could manage.  Arkonel shrugged Gena off when she hugged him.

  “Its okay.  I don’t look forward to telling Ari, but until she knows, stuff like this will continue to happen.  This is completely my fault, and I apologize.”  Arkonel said, still angered by the drunk.  He had finally managed to stand up straight and dial 911.

  “Tell me what?”  Ari asked from the door way.  Arkonel hadn’t even noticed her entrance into the house.  “I heard the noise – mom, are you okay?”  Ari rushed over to her mother, and her mother nodded.

  “Please, tell her.  I have some business to take care of.  Here are the keys to him.”  Arkonel handed the set of keys to Gena.  He turned his attention to Ari.

 “Forgive me.”  Arkonel gripped Ari’s hand and squeezed, and then walked out the door to disappear.
