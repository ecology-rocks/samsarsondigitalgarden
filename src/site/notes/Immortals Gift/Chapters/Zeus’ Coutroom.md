# Zeus’ Coutroom

  “Shut up, Arkonel.  You should be glad I haven’t sent you to help process the dead with Hades from now until the end of this century.  And you know the third world war is coming; you would have to deal with all of those dead Christian soldiers.”  Zeus’ thunderous voice echoed in the vast atrium, silencing Arkonel’s complaints.  “All you have to do is keep a young woman, Ariana, company.  She is one of ours, nonetheless.  Do you think, you lowly piece of rat scum, you can handle that?”

Arkonel’s small head nodded.  Had he wanted to speak, he couldn’t have.  He knew when he was about to push his father too far, and he was right at that point.  He was actually surprised he hadn’t been fried by lightning, yet. 

  “Good.  You will maintain human form in front of her.  You will try your best not to interact with anyone else around her.  And the minute you start causing trouble and she starts praying to have you removed from her life, you’re done.  Do you understand me?”  The last four words shook Arkonel’s body so hard he was flung into the chair he had been standing in front of.  Standing, dazed, he nodded.

  “Good.  You will report here once a week, in the night.  You will watch over her and her mother on all other nights.  And Arkonel, this is your last chance.  You can’t keep killing humans for fun.  Or, you sick son of a bitch, getting them to kill each other for your own amusement.  Get out of my sight.”

  “Am I to tell them?”

  “That is your choice.  You must follow the rules of human interaction.  Aphrodite only can make the exceptions to those rules, and we all know your capacity to love.  Out.”

  “Yes sir.” Arkonel saluted to his father and did an about face.  As much courage and stamina as Arkonel may have, no one pissed off Zeus.  He was the king of the gods.  The only person he answered to was the Lord and Lady.
