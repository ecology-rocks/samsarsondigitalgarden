# Repercussions

  “Why on earth did you let him _kill_ me, Arkonel?  You know that’s not the way I wanted to go!”  Ariana’s angry screams echoed as soon as he entered Aphrodite’s home.  His aunt looked on, amused.  “That fucking hurt! A lot!”

  “Well, you said you wanted to experience death…”  Arkonel said, a little too late for his own benefit.  Ariana’s new immortal hand reached out and slapped him across the face.

  “I’m sorry, Ari.  I really didn’t think he was going to react that way.  I wanted to change you, to be with you.”

  “Aphrodite already told me.  When were you going to tell me that you planned to sleep with me?”

  “Well, considering we’re going to spend eternity together, I figured it was pretty obvious.”  Arkonel said, an impish grin spreading across his face, which still stung from the slap.

  “Argh!  I don’t know if I want to talk to you anymore!”

  “Look, Ari, I’m really sorry.  It is completely my fault, and all I want is for you to be happy.  Now, if you let me show you how to create a mortal body, you can go back down, and we can at least pretend you’re about to be changed…”  Arkonel’s comment earned him a glare, but no slap. 

  “Is your brother going to be…punished?  At all?”

  “Yes, by the council.  He was _not_ supposed to kidnap you, and he definitely was not supposed to kill you.  That is a big no-no in Olympus.  We change our own, here.”

  “So basically, he’s going to be punished because he’s an ass hole.”

  “Yes.  Absolutely.”  Arkonel agreed with her.  “Can I have a hug?”

Ari wrapped her arms around him, and hugged him tight.  She was very confused at first, but Aphrodite had cleared it all up for her.  Ari brushed Arkonel’s hair out of the way of his ear.

  “I wasn’t really sure if I could have slept…or slept with you.  I’m kind of glad he changed me.  It was so unexpected…it made it less frightening.  Well, it was frightening, and it hurt…but it helped, not having control of the situation.”

  “So you’re glad that my brother killed you to piss me off?”

  “Something like that.  But don’t think you can go around having me killed over and over again.  The charm only works once.”

  “I’ll keep that in mind.”  Arkonel said as he pulled back from the hug and kissed her.  Together for eternity.
